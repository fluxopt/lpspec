description: House rules for writing documentation prose in this project — what a page is for, how it is shaped, and the sentence-level bar. Use when writing a new documentation page or section, or when adding prose to an existing one.

# Writing docs here

These are the rules a page has to meet. They apply to prose you write now and
to prose already on the page: a page that does not meet them is not finished,
whoever wrote it.

The reader knows the domain — optimization models, YAML, a bit of maths — and
knows nothing about this project. Write for that person.

## The voice

Plain, direct, professional. Explain to a smart adult who does not work on
this project. They are not stupid, they are unfamiliar.

- **Say the answer first**, then why. A section that builds to its point makes
  the reader hold everything until the end.
- **Short sentences, short words.** "Use" not "utilise", "before" not "prior
  to", "so" not "in order that". A term the language or the API owns —
  `piecewise`, a coordinate, a source, a sink — is never swapped for a plainer
  word, but everything around it is.
- **Snappy is short, not clipped.** A four-word fragment that costs a re-read
  is worse than the ten-word sentence it replaced.
- **Confident and flat.** State the rule. Do not hedge with "generally",
  "typically", "in most cases" unless the exception is real, and then name the
  exception instead.
- **No enthusiasm, no marketing.** No "powerful", "seamless", "elegant",
  "simply", "just", "of course", "as you can see", "note that". Each of these
  either tells the reader their confusion is their fault, or says nothing.
- **No jokes and no asides.** A reader hitting this page is stuck, and reads
  it in a hurry.
- **No apology and no warning voice.** "Unfortunately", "be careful",
  "beware" — say what happens and what to write instead.
- **One spelling convention per page.** The tree is mixed and this skill does
  not settle it: match the page you are on.

## 1. Decide what the page is before writing a sentence

Two questions decide it, and they work on a paragraph as well as a page:

1. Does it inform **action** or **cognition**?
2. Does it serve **acquiring** a skill or **applying** one?

| Kind        | Informs   | Serves  | Answers                        | Lives in                                       |
| ----------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Tutorial    | action    | acquire | "Get me a first working model" | `docs/index.md`, `docs/guide.md`, the notebooks |
| How-to      | action    | apply   | "I have this task"             | `docs/examples/data.md`                        |
| Reference   | cognition | apply   | "What exactly does X accept?"  | `docs/reference/`, the model pages             |
| Explanation | cognition | acquire | "Why is it like this?"         | `docs/about/`                                  |

Each kind has one job, and one thing it must not do:

- **A tutorial is a lesson.** One path, every step shows a result, and the
  reader finishes with a model that solves. It explains nothing and offers no
  choice: a choice is a how-to leaking in.
- **A how-to is a recipe.** The title names the goal, the body is the steps,
  and the reader is assumed competent. It neither teaches nor explains.
- **Reference describes, and only describes.** One consistent format, and a
  structure that mirrors what it describes: the API page follows the verbs,
  the data page follows the contract. No rationale, no instruction.
- **Explanation is the one place for why.** Context, alternatives and opinion
  live here and nowhere else, within what `AGENTS.md` sends to the PR.

**A model page is reference in its own form.** It answers "can the language
say my model, and is the answer right?", and its shape is a witness rather
than a table: a summary sentence, the problem as its field writes it, the
YAML with its math generated from it, and a badge naming the oracle it agreed
with. Its rules follow from that. The summary sentence is the model's one
description anywhere, and the catalogue quotes it. The hand-written math uses
only symbols the generator can reach, or names why it deviates. The YAML and
Python are asserted against the files that run. Nothing on the page is prose
you argue.

Mixing kinds is the most common failure. Rationale inside a reference section
makes the rules unskimmable, and rules inside an explanation page make the
argument unreadable. Most rationale belongs in the PR, per `AGENTS.md`; what
survives into an explanation page is the part a user needs to make decisions.

The language is not documented here. What a model file may contain is
math-spec's to state, and the nav links to its
[language reference](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/language/).
A page here documents what this package does with a spec: the data it
attaches, the verbs that attach it, and the models that do both.

Answer the two questions before starting. If a page needs two kinds, it is
two sections with two headings, or two pages.

## 2. Open with the purpose

One sentence, above the first rule, saying what the page is for and who needs
it. No throat-clearing, no restating the title, no "in this section we will".

Then the shape a reader needs, in this order:

1. **Shape** — the smallest thing they can write that works.
2. **Rules** — what is accepted, and what is refused.
3. **Rationale** — only where it changes what they write.

The subtlest rule gets the most support: a list, a worked example, a table.
The obvious rule gets one sentence.

## 3. Every rule carries an example, and the example is real

- **Show the input and its result side by side.** YAML next to the maths it
  renders, a call next to its output. Never in a later subsection.
- **Every example is checked, by `tests/test_doc_examples.py`.** A YAML
  fence is validated whole through `to_spec`; a Python fence must parse and
  name only attributes the API has. A YAML fragment that cannot stand alone
  says so in an HTML comment on the line before the fence:
  `<!-- doctest: wrap=<section> -->` for one entry of a schema section,
  `<!-- doctest: skip -->` for a block that is not a model or is wrong on
  purpose. Prefer completing the fragment over skipping it.
- **Quote error messages whole.** This project's messages name the rewrite,
  and a truncated quote drops exactly the half that teaches.
- **Prefer the smallest example that still shows the point.** A model with two
  dimensions and one variable teaches; a realistic one hides the rule in
  scenery.
- **Show the refused form too**, where the refusal is the lesson, with the
  message it produces.

## 4. Headings are the table of contents

- **Topic nouns, sentence case.** "Quadratic expressions", not "Degree 2 in
  the math, degree 1 beside it". The test: a reader who types the subject into
  the search box should land on this heading.
- **Never a conclusion the reader cannot parse yet.** A heading is read before
  the section, so it cannot depend on it.
- **One `##` per idea.** A section that needs a paragraph of preamble before
  its first rule is two sections.

## 5. Bold lead-ins are the skim layer

A reader who reads only the bold lead-ins of a list must come away correct and
complete. Write them that way deliberately: each is a claim, not a label.

```markdown
- **Absence spreads through arithmetic.** A sum with one absent term is absent.
```

not

```markdown
- **Arithmetic.** ...
```

## 6. Vocabulary

- **Gloss house vocabulary at first use** — _spec_, _program_, _model_,
  _result_, _source_, _sink_, _coordinate_, _frame_, _mask_. One clause with a
  concrete instance: "one point of it, one snapshot for one generator, is a
  coordinate".
- **Gloss every acronym and domain term at first use**, in parentheses, six
  words or fewer.
- **One word per concept, for the whole page.** _dims_, _dimensions_ and
  _frame_ are three words, and a reader counts three ideas. Vary nothing for
  rhythm.
- **No overloaded words** — do not write "the case in point" beside a `cases:`
  keyword.
- **Gloss where the term is used**, and link
  `docs/reference/glossary.md` rather than redefine it.
  The glossary holds the one definition; a second copy drifts.
- **Link the reference section at a construct's first mention** on the page.
  A language construct links to math-spec's reference; a verb links to
  `docs/reference/api.md`.

## 7. Sentences

The bar, and it is checkable:

1. **One idea per sentence.** Median at or under 20 words; over 25 is where a
   newcomer re-reads.
2. **Active voice, with a real subject.** "The loader refuses it before any
   data binds", not "the refusal comes before any data binds". An abstract
   noun as subject is the single biggest reason technical prose reads
   expert-only.
3. **State the rule in things, then in abstractions.** "One generator at one
   snapshot cannot have two previous statuses" before "two values at one
   coordinate is not a quantity".
4. **Address the reader for what they do.** "Close such a hole in one of three
   ways". A rule about the language is about the language, not about "the
   modeller".
5. **A full stop, not an em dash, between two independent clauses.** Both
   halves having a subject and a verb is the test. Keep the dash for an aside
   inside one clause, and use few.
6. **No fronted participles** that suspend the subject: "Having no mask to
   narrow its frame, it is the one that…".
7. **No elided possessives**: "The dims of a cased one cannot", not "A cased
   one's cannot".
8. **A pronoun names its subject again** once a clause has intervened.
9. **No double negatives, no metaphor stacked on metaphor, no relative clauses
   stacked without _that_.**
10. **Say it once.** The same claim in three paragraphs is load-bearing in
    none.

Measure before committing, and put the numbers in the commit body. The number
is evidence, not a target: a list-shaped sentence may be long and clear.

## 8. What does not go on the page

- **History.** "Previously this used to…", "renamed from…" — that is git.
- **Argument for a settled decision.** That is the PR.
- **A promise about the future.** "Will support…" ages into a lie.
- **Anything that duplicates another page.** One fact, one home; link instead.
  A second copy drifts silently. A rule of the language is math-spec's page,
  not a paraphrase here.
- **Generated content.** The catalogue, construct matrix and reference table
  in `docs/examples/index.md`, the *"the same model, as math"* block on each
  model page, and the tables in `docs/about/benchmarks.md` are written by a
  tool, between `<!-- …:begin -->` and `<!-- …:end -->` markers. Change the
  generator, named in `docs/README.md`.

## 9. Mechanics

- **A new page needs a nav entry in `mkdocs.yml`.** The docs build is
  `--strict`, so a page without one fails it, as do a dead cross-link and a
  stale anchor.
- **Inside `docs/`, link relatively; outside it, write the full GitHub URL.**
  A relative link above `docs/` renders in the repo and 404s on the site, and
  `tests/test_docs_site.py` refuses it.
- **A diagram carries alt text**, and no rule is stated in colour alone.
- **Tables for what varies along one axis** — accepted keys, sink
  capabilities. Prose for what has an order or a reason.

## 10. Gates

```bash
pixi run docs-build   # --strict, so a dead anchor is a failure
pixi run pytest tests/test_doc_examples.py tests/test_docs_site.py -q
```

Say which gate ran and what was left unrun.
