"""A rung's model: the one file, cut to what the rung builds.

The file states every row PyPSA can emit; a rung's network builds some of
them. Its projection keeps the constraints with rows built and the variables
with columns built, drops from every kept expression the additive terms over
variables the rung never builds or parameters and lookups it never feeds —
they contribute nothing — and keeps the parameters, lookups and dimensions
those blocks still name. Derived, never
edited: the parity runner writes one per rung from the certificate, solves it
and holds it to PyPSA's objective, so a cut that lost something load-bearing
is a red run rather than a quiet lie.
