"""The coverage question the block-level one cannot reach, as a rule with no data in it.

Its own module because it is *pure* — stamps and a program in, sentences out —
and `parity.py` cannot be imported without pypsa. A rule nothing can test

    The half the block-level coverage cannot reach. A mask is exercised as a
    whole the moment one of its conjuncts varies, so `committable AND
    p_nom_mod > 0` passes while `committable` is true at every coordinate of
    every rung — and a regime guarded by that conjunct alone would be missing
    with nothing to say so. That is the shape the negative-`p_min_pu` gap had,
    found by hand (math-spec#312); this is the sweep that would have found it.

    Each rung records one character per conjunct — ``t`` held everywhere, ``f``
    nowhere, ``b`` at some coordinates, ``-`` no frame at all. A conjunct is
    exercised when the ladder has it true somewhere (``t`` or ``b``) and false
    somewhere (``f`` or ``b``), which one ``b`` satisfies alone and two rungs
    disagreeing satisfy between them.

    A conjunct of a block no rung builds is not reported: that block is already
    a louder gap one line up, and saying it twice buries it.
