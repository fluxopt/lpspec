"""Is the data there where a declaration needs it? The two positions that ask.

Everything else in this lane reads an absent parameter row as a zero
coefficient (the absence rules). These are the two places that reading has no
answer for: **a divisor**, where zero is not a divisor at all, and **a constant
side**, where zero is the bound rather than the absence of one. Both are
decided against the rows the declaration actually builds, so a ``where`` that
removed the coordinate has already answered. The walk itself is
``program.children`` and ``program.parameters_of``, so "which names can reach a
divisor" is answered once for both lanes.
