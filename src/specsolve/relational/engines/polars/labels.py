"""Dense solver indices for a masked coordinate product.

**Labels are the one place order is load-bearing.** ``var_label`` *is* the
solver's column index and ``row`` its row index, so a label is the model's
identity: two builds of one model must agree on it integer for integer
(docs/about/architecture.md, "The relational lane").

Variables and constraint rows are the same operation over different frames, so
[`frame`][] is written once — one rule, sort the survivors into declaration
order and number them from *start*. A mask, a restriction or neither produce
the same shape down to the schema.

The one split kept is *how much product is materialised*. A mask that cannot
see the leading dims removes the same coordinates under every one of their
values, so the survivors are a rectangle and only the masked suffix needs rows
([`_factored`][]).

    remapping.

    *restrictions* are variable-presence frames a constraint row must be
    contained in (the absence rules). They are semi-joins, so they
    only remove rows, and nothing deduplicates them — a key occurring twice
    still occurs. Which rows they remove is unknown until data is read, so a
    restriction takes the counted path whatever the mask looks like.

    No dims means the carrier is [`UNIT`][], selected because selecting
    nothing would drop the one row of the empty coordinate product.

    **Nothing sorts unless the data says it must.** The product is *produced*
    in declaration order, a filter keeps it and a semi-join usually does, so
    [`in_position_order`][] verifies linearly and sorts only when the engine
    emitted another order.

    **Nothing renumbers unless a row was dropped**, either. With neither mask
    nor restriction, ``start + position`` *is* the label and the row-index pass
    never runs. Nothing projects there either: the query selected the dims and the
    label in that order, so the projection the renumbered path ends on would
    copy every column to itself, and what is left to do is set the sorted flag
    the scan established.
