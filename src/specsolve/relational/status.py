"""What a solve returned, on two axes.

Copied spelling for spelling from ``linopy.constants``;
`tests/test_solve_status.py` asserts the tables still match. Nothing here
imports linopy — the engine may not (hard rule 2) — but the test does.

The two axes stay separate: ``termination_condition`` is what the solver said,
``status`` what it means for the caller. **ok does not mean optimal** — a run
stopped at a time limit with an incumbent is ``ok``, there being values worth
reading.
