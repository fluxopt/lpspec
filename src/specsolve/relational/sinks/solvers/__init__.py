"""The solver family: one class per solver, holding one model. See ../README.md.

One module per solver, **named for the solver**. Each defines a
:class:`~specsolve.relational.sinks.solvers.base.Solver` subclass named for it,
plus ``build_<name>``, the load-only seam `bench/` measures.
``tests/test_architecture.py`` checks all of that off the path.

What a solver holds between solves, and the rule for keeping it, is
:mod:`~specsolve.relational.sinks.solvers.base` — the one module a member may read
besides ``tables.py``.
