"""The ``xpress`` solver: the model in two calls, straight into the Optimizer.

The same hand-off as :mod:`~specsolve.relational.sinks.solvers.highs`, reading the
same ``dense_columns``, ``dense_rows`` and ``row_blocks``, so no two sinks can
disagree about the model they load. What differs:

- **The matrix is row-major and stays that way.** ``addRows`` takes the CSR
  triple a block already is — no ``scipy`` wrapper, and the extra carries
  nothing but ``xpress`` itself.
- **The objective's constant is a column.** Xpress spells it as the objective
  coefficient of column ``-1``, *negated*, where the other two have an
  attribute for it.
- **Forgetting is a control, not a call.** ``problem.reset()`` clears the whole
  problem here, so what discards the last solve's work is ``keepbasis``; see
  :meth:`Xpress.forget`.

``xpress`` is imported inside the functions, so importing this module stays
free for a caller who never solves with it.
