"""Sinks: how a built model leaves the engine. See README.md.

**Two families.** A *solver* takes the handoff and runs it (``solvers/``,
chosen by name); a *writer* renders it to a file (``writers/``, chosen by
suffix). They are directories, so ``tests/test_architecture.py`` reads
membership off the path.

``handoff.py`` is what both read, and neither family imports the other.
``capabilities.py`` is what both *declare*, and the functions below are where
a caller's model meets those declarations — the only place the two families are
asked one question together.
