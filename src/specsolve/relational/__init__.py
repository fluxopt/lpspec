"""**Internal:** relational LP construction — the streaming lane.

The public interface of the package is YAML (see ``specsolve.api``); constructing
programs in Python is not supported API.

**Two layers, and the directory says which is which.** ``sinks/``,
``status.py`` and ``result.py`` are the contract: what an engine answers to and
what a sink reads. What a model *is* is upstream of both — ``math_spec.program``
— which is why no module here declares it. ``engines/`` holds implementations
of that contract, one per directory. A **solver's** own package is imported
inside the function that calls it, so one a caller has not installed never
reaches their import path.

Nothing is re-exported here. Every consumer imports from the module that owns
the name.
