"""The runner: attach data to a YAML spec and execute it. Not a modeling API.

Math is defined in YAML only — there is no Python API for constructing specs,
and the logical plan is internal. Four verbs run a model: ``check``, ``build``
(YAML + sources → a :class:`Model`), ``solve`` and ``write``. ``load_result`` reads back an
answer :meth:`Result.save` wrote; the question and the answer as one archive
is :class:`lpspec.artifact.Artifact`.

This is the relational lane (docs/about/architecture.md): validated at load
time, lowered to the plan, executed relationally. The same file builds as a
``linopy.Model`` through ``lpspec.linopy``, on the same call and the same
sources — which lane a caller wants is theirs to pick, and this one needs no
optional extra.

Example::

    import lpspec as lps

    result = lps.solve(
        'spec.yaml',
        {'p_max': 'p_max.parquet', 'load': 'load.parquet', 'snapshot': range(8760)},
    )
    result.objective
    result.primal('p')  # tidy polars.DataFrame (coords..., value)
