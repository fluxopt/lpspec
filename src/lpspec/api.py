"""The runner: attach data to a YAML spec and execute it. Not a modeling API.

Math is defined in YAML only — there is no Python API for constructing specs,
and the logical plan is internal. Four verbs: ``check``, ``build`` (YAML +
sources → a :class:`Model`), ``solve`` and ``write``.

This is the relational lane (docs/about/architecture.md): validated at load
time, lowered to the plan, executed relationally. The same file builds as a
``linopy.Model`` through linopy's own ``Model.from_spec`` — a second consumer
of the same language, in another package, which is what the differential suite
measures this one against.

Example::

    import lpspec as lps

    result = lps.solve(
        'spec.yaml',
        {'p_max': 'p_max.parquet', 'load': 'load.parquet', 'snapshot': range(8760)},
    )
    result.objective
    result.primal('p')  # tidy polars.DataFrame (coords..., value)
