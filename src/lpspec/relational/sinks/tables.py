    and ``matrix`` in CSR: ``(col, coeff)`` in row-major order, with
    ``row_starts[r] : row_starts[r + 1]`` the half-open span row ``r`` owns.
    The objective constant lives outside the frames, having no column to
    attach to.

    ``quad`` is the objective's quadratic part, in ``(col_l, col_r)`` order,
    one row per **unordered pair** of columns: the objective contains ``coeff · x[col_l] · x[col_r]``, whole.
    Three sinks spell that three ways — a Hessian is :math:`\frac12 x^\top Q x`,
    the LP section is divided by two, Gurobi takes :math:`x^\top Q x` — so what
    arrives here is the algebra and the conversion belongs to whoever loads it.
    Empty for every affine model, which is nearly all of them.

    ``qmatrix`` is the same form for the *rows* that carry one:
    ``(row, col_l, col_r, coeff)`` in that order. The rows it names are a
    **contiguous tail** of the label space — quadratic is a property of a
    declaration, so the engine builds those last — which lets a sink holding
    linear and quadratic rows in different objects read its answer back as two
    runs rather than a scatter, beginning at :attr:`linear_row_count`.

    ``sos`` is the fifth stream and the one that lands unevenly: ``(set, type,
    col, weight)`` in ``(set, weight)`` order, one row per member, empty for
    the models that declare none. It is the only frame a sink may be unable to
    ingest — SOS is a *sink capability*, not a property of the model — so a
    solver without the concept states so and is handed
    :func:`~lpspec.relational.sinks.sos.reformulated` tables instead.

    ``cols``, ``rows`` and ``matrix`` all arrive in the solver's own order —
    ``cols`` by column, the other two by row — which is what lets every dense
    vector be read positionally rather than keyed.

    ``col`` and ``row`` are dense ``0..n-1``, so they *are* the solver's own
    indices and no sink builds a mapping. **``cols`` carries no ``col`` and
    ``matrix`` no ``row``**: a ``cols`` row's position is its index and a
    matrix entry's row is where it sits between two starts, which is what a
    solver's matrix API takes — where a row label per nonzero would hold
    8 bytes an entry for the model's lifetime. :meth:`matrix_block` spells them
    back out for the one consumer that renders them. ``obj`` keeps its ``col``,
    being genuinely sparse (0.71 of ``cols`` on `transport`).
