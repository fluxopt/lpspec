"""What every solver is: a loaded model, and the rule for keeping it.

A solver sink holds the model it was given and outlives the solve it was loaded
for, so that an updated model (:meth:`~lpspec.api.Model.update`) has its new
numbers *pushed* onto what the solver already has and re-solves from the basis
the last one ended on. linopy's shape, and its word: their ``Solver`` is the
persistent object too. Copied rather than imported, and tested here.

**This module imports no solver.** It is the one thing ``solvers/`` members may
read besides ``tables.py``, and that is the whole reason it can exist: the fence
`tests/test_architecture.py` draws keeps ``gurobipy`` off the import path of a
caller who solves with HiGHS, and a base that reaches for neither cannot carry
one across. Sharing through it is what stops the alternative — one leaf importing
the other — from ever being the tempting option.
