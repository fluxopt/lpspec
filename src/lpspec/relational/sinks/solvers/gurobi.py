"""The ``gurobi`` solver: the model in two calls, straight into gurobipy.

The same hand-off as :mod:`~lpspec.relational.sinks.solvers.highs`, reading the
same ``dense_columns``, ``dense_rows`` and ``row_blocks``, so the two cannot
disagree about the model they load. Two things differ:

- **The matrix's currency.** HiGHS takes the three CSR arrays; gurobipy's
  matrix API takes a matrix *object*, so they are wrapped in a
  ``scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`` — a view, not a copy. That wrapper is why the
  ``[gurobi]`` extra carries scipy: the alternative is a Python call per row.
- **Nothing is batched.** The columns cannot be, since ``addMConstr`` writes
  into one ``MVar`` spanning the model — and the matrix *should* not be, which
  is where this sink parts company with the HiGHS one. See
  :meth:`~lpspec.relational.sinks.tables.Tables.row_blocks`.

**A column costs 192 bytes of Python objects here, on top of the solver's
own.** gurobipy backs an ``MVar`` with one ``Var`` object per column and
reads and writes every attribute through them, so a model of a million
columns holds ~190 MB of them for as long as it is loaded, and a garbage
collection that runs while they are young walks all of them (#1288). There
is no object-free path — a file round trip only defers the same objects to
the first read-back — so this is the price of the sink rather than a cost
of it.

``gurobipy`` and ``scipy`` are imported inside the functions, so importing
this module stays free for a caller who never solves with it.

    recomputes it — the solver's own number is the one feasibility was judged

    Blocks were added in ascending row ranges and the quadratic rows after
    them, so concatenating their slices reproduces the row index without a
    sort — and :meth:`Solver.run` checks the vector spans the model. Gurobi
    refuses ``Pi`` on a mixed-integer model, and that refusal *is* the answer
    — no zero vector to test.

    A quadratic row prices through ``QCPi``, which exists **only under
    ``QCPDual``** — off by default and deliberately left off: asking for it
    puts the solve on the convex path, and a nonconvex row that solves without
    it then fails outright (measured: ``Constraint Q not PSD``). A caller who
    wants prices asks with ``solver_options={'QCPDual': 1}``; without it the
    attribute is refused, and that refusal *is* the answer.
