"""The ``highs`` solver: the whole model straight into HiGHS, in one call.

The default, and the only one whose dependency ships with the package. Every
vector crosses as a numpy buffer, with no float→text→parse round trip — which
is why this exists beside
:mod:`~lpspec.relational.sinks.writers.lp_file`.

**Nothing textual crosses into numpy**: a row's ``'<='`` becomes a
:data:`~lpspec.relational.sinks.tables.SENSE_CODES` byte before it is read
here.

``highspy`` is imported inside the function, being optional: importing this
module stays free for callers that only write LP files.

:class:`Highs` is the same hand-off held open — what a driver that re-solves
one model with new numbers uses, and where the warm basis lives.
