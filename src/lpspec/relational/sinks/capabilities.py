"""What a sink can ingest — the axis that is not the ceiling.

The ceiling is about streamability and is solver-independent
(docs/about/ceiling.md); what a *sink* can take is separate, and conflating the
two let one solver's limits read as architectural law. One descriptor per sink,
so a construct the language says and a sink cannot take is a refusal naming
both rather than a ``kError`` from inside a library.

Four shapes, each forced by docs/about/benchmarks.md#sink-capabilities rather
than chosen:

- **Three-valued.** ``reformulated`` is an answer, not a missing ``native``: a
  set reaches HiGHS as binaries and linking rows and the model still solves, at
  the cost of the duals an LP would have returned.
- **Exclusions.** HiGHS takes a Hessian, takes integrality, and refuses the
  pair — which linopy's flat ``frozenset`` reports as MIQP available.
- **Some entries are data-time.** Convexity is a property of coefficients, so
  ``check`` cannot answer it (rule 2). ``nonconvex_quadratic_objective`` is
  declared anyway: the sink that discovers it at solve time reads the sinks
  that would have taken it off this table.
- **A descriptor describes the sink as shipped, not the library it wraps.** A
  solver that takes a Hessian through an entry point this package does not call
  cannot ingest a quadratic objective *here*, and saying otherwise would drop
  the quadratic part and answer a different model's optimum. An entry moves
  when the hand-off lands, so the benchmarks table may be ahead of it.
