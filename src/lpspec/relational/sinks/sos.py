r"""A set expressed as columns and rows, for a sink with no concept of one.

Which sink needs this and why the family rather than a member decides it:
``README.md``, *the one uneven stream*.

The formulation is linopy's (``linopy/sos_reformulation.py``), member for
member, because this stream is measured against linopy's own build of the same
spec and a differently relaxed MILP is a different search even where it is the
same feasible set. For
members :math:`x_1 … x_k` in weight order, with :math:`M_i` the tighter of the
block's ``big_m`` and the member's own upper bound:

- **SOS1** — a binary :math:`y_i` per member, :math:`x_i \le M_i y_i`, and
  :math:`\sum_i y_i \le 1`.
- **SOS2** — a binary :math:`z_j` per *segment*, :math:`j = 1 … k-1`, with
  :math:`x_1 \le M_1 z_1`, :math:`x_i \le M_i (z_{i-1} + z_i)`,
  :math:`x_k \le M_k z_{k-1}`, and :math:`\sum_j z_j \le 1`.

Everything it adds goes **after** the model, so an appended column moves none
of the model's own and an appended row renumbers none of its rows — the label
contract spent (docs/about/architecture.md), and why a solve reads its answer back by
the same slice either way.

**Nothing here sorts, groups or joins.** The stream arrives in ``(set, weight)``
order, so every question about a set — where it starts, where it ends, which
binary a member reaches — is a comparison against the neighbouring row, and the
rows it emits are produced in the order CSR wants them.

**It asks them in numpy rather than in polars**, the one place this lane
departs from the rest of the sink (``tables._scattered`` and the engine's own
CSR index are the precedents): every question above is a scan or a scatter over
one contiguous buffer, where an expression frame would carry a dozen columns
across the whole member stream to answer them — a factor of two at 2M members
(#687).
