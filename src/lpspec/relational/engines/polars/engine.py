"""Polars engine: build the model frames, hand them to a sink, read the answer back.

The engine owns the lifecycle — a build, its solver, the counters and clocks
:meth:`PolarsEngine.diagnostics` reports — and none of the three questions it
asks on the way: what the data is (:mod:`~lpspec.relational.engines.polars.attaching`),
what each declaration contributes (:mod:`~lpspec.relational.engines.polars.assembly`),
how a row or a solve reads back (:mod:`~lpspec.relational.engines.polars.readback`).
The lane is described in docs/about/architecture.md.
