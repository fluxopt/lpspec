"""Re-indexing along one dimension's own order: ``shift`` and ``sum_back``.

The two operators that move a fragment's rows *along* a dimension rather than
across dims. ``shift`` is a pointwise remap of the dim through its ordinal —
one output row per input row — and ``sum_back`` a one-to-many one, a row at
*o* contributing at every ``o + lag`` inside the window. They share the
ordinal arithmetic, the scratch columns below, and the question no other
operator has to answer: what happens at the edge, where the walk runs out of
dimension.

Both take the :class:`~lpspec.relational.engines.polars.compiler.PolarsCompiler`
and hold nothing. They read four things off it — ``data``, ``program``,
``partitioned`` and ``widen`` — and everything else here is their own.
