"""The algebra of additive pieces: what an expression compiles *to*.

An LP row is a sum of pieces, so a compiled expression is a list of fragments
and every shape operator rewrites one. This module is that vocabulary and the
arithmetic over it — product, quotient, power, negation, and the absence rule
that decides which rows a reduction is allowed to see.

It holds no state and reads no data: everything here takes fragments and
returns fragments, which is what lets
:mod:`~lpspec.relational.engines.polars.compiler` be about *which* query a plan
node becomes rather than about what a term is.
