"""Is the data there where a declaration needs it? The positions that ask.

Everything else in this lane reads an absent parameter row as a zero
coefficient (the absence rules). These are the positions that reading has no
answer for — a **divisor**, where zero is not a divisor at all, and a
**constant piece**, where zero is the bound rather than the absence of one —
and each is asked at the last moment the gap is still visible:

=============================  ===================================  ==========================================
position                       the gap looks like                   asked
=============================  ===================================  ==========================================
a divisor under a term         a null coefficient in the share      before the terminal aggregate reads it as 0
a divisor under a constant     a null value in the piece            before :func:`~fragments.constant_scalar` sums it away
a constant piece the row sees  a null after the join onto the rows  on the rows pass itself
a constant piece summed away   a coordinate the parameter lacks     of the parameter, the piece no longer showing it
=============================  ===================================  ==========================================

Which parameters stand as constant pieces, and under which region of a
``cases:`` block, is read off the fragments the compiler built
(:attr:`~fragments.TermFragment.parameters`,
:attr:`~fragments.TermFragment.region`), so the rule is decided once, where
the pieces are made.
