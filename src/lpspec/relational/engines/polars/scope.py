"""The scope a query is compiled in: what each name stands for, and what a dimension means as a coordinate.

What every query in the lane is written against, and what each helper takes
— the labeller, the mask walk, the reindexing operators, the coverage
guards — none of which compiles an expression. The compiler holds one of
these beside the walk it adds.

``data`` is everything attaching produced, frozen. ``variables`` is the
build's own dict, not a copy: a variable frame appears while its declaration
is built and a constraint compiled afterwards has to see it — the one live
registry in the lane, visible in this signature.
