The door (:func:`~lpspec.sources.tidy_sources`) has already read and checked
every source; this gives each the shape the query is written against, and
encodes the string dimensions. Everything downstream reads
:class:`AttachedSources` and nothing else.

then read to construct the compiler and the labeller — unlike the one registry
that is deliberately *live*, the variable frames, which appear as declarations
