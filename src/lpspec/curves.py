"""The data-time guard on a ``piecewise:`` curve.

The language decides a curve's *shape* — which links it has, which method
builds it — and can decide nothing about its numbers, because it has never
seen one. This is the other half: given the tidy sources, is the curve
supplied everywhere the block builds a weight for it, and does it hold what
its method rests on. What those conditions *are* is the language's answer —
a block carries them as :data:`~math_spec.program.Check` values, each naming
its own subjects, and :func:`~math_spec.program.check_message` words the
refusal — so what is decided here is only whether the numbers hold them, and
this module appends what it saw.

Called from :func:`~lpspec.sources.tidy_sources`, so both lanes pass through it
by entering the one door.

Separate from ``sources.py`` because the question is different: that module
asks what shape a caller's table is in, this one asks whether the numbers in it
describe a curve the declared method can build.

    :class:`~math_spec.program.MaskOf` is the mask a ``points: bp_x`` asked for

    segment lines, so it needs two rows holding the linked expression inside
    the curve's *own* range, and a ``where:`` has no operator to find them
    with.

    Every frame is true-only and sparse, since a missing row reads as false in
