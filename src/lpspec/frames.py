"""The one place that knows what a caller's table library is.

What a caller hands over is learned from the Arrow PyCapsule protocol, not from
an import, so neither pyarrow nor pandas is a dependency. ``pandas.Series`` has
no capsule that carries its index, so it is unwrapped first — and only when
pandas is already in ``sys.modules``.

**Tables in, arrays out.** What is read here is a table: rows under named
columns, an index being a column wearing a hat. An ``xarray.DataArray`` is a
dense n-dimensional array rather than a table, and taking one would be this
package agreeing that a parameter is a rectangle already materialised. xarray
is what a result is handed back *as* (``to_dataarray``) and what the linopy
lane builds internally, never what either lane reads.
