"""The feasible region on two axes: what a model *can* do, drawn rather than solved.

A model's feasible set has one dimension per column, and nothing draws that.
What a modeller checks is its shadow on two quantities they can name — heat
against power for a plant, storage level against spill — which is a convex
polygon for a linear model, and each of its vertices is the answer to one
solve: maximise the two quantities weighted by a direction, and the optimum
is the vertex that direction points at. So the region is found by solving
the same built model along a sequence of directions, which is what
:func:`project` does, on the fast path the whole way: only two costs change
between solves, so the solver keeps the model and carries its basis.

What comes back is a :class:`Region` of four tidy frames — the vertices, what
each piece pinned, which bound or row each edge sits on, and where the
model's own optimum lands — and :meth:`Region.plot`, a plotly figure with
those frames as its hover, which is the ``[plot]`` extra rather than the
engine's.

A binary makes the region a union of polygons rather than one, and a solve
along a direction only ever finds the hull of the union. ``binaries='each'``
fixes every combination of the binaries in turn — a pair of rows per binary
whose right-hand sides are data, so each combination is a push onto the
loaded solver — and traces the region each leaves as a piece of the whole.

    Attributes:
        x: The quantity on the horizontal axis.

            they were traced apart, which is what a free trace would give.

            ``i`` runs from vertex ``i`` to the next; a segment has one edge.

        optimum: ``(piece, x, y)`` — where the model *as written* lands, and

        region.plot()  # a plotly figure: the polygon, its edges on hover, the optimum marked

    The region is every ``(x, y)`` some feasible solution reaches, which the
    objective plays no part in: the file's is set aside and the solve is
    driven by a direction instead. For a continuous model the polygon is
    exact — every vertex is a solve, and an edge is kept only once a solve
    along its outward normal finds nothing beyond it. The model's own
    optimum is one more solve, marked on the region it sits in.

    A binary makes the region a union of polygons, one per combination, and
    with the binaries **free** a solve along a direction finds only the
    **convex hull** of that union: each solve still returns an extreme point
    of it, so the hull is exact, and what it encloses may have holes it
    cannot show. ``binaries='each'`` traces the pieces instead: every
    combination of the binary columns *at* reaches — all of them, with no
    *at* — is pinned in turn and its region traced, so a plant's on/off
    states come back as the separate polygons they are. An infeasible
    combination is left out rather than raised — the first solve, with every
    binary free, is the one that says whether there is a region at all. An
    ``integer`` variable is never pinned, so a piece holding one is, again,
    a hull.

    *at* fixes coordinates, and the rest is summed: with ``at={'t': 5}`` a
    quantity over ``(t, unit)`` is read at that hour and totalled over the
    units, and with no *at* it is totalled over everything. A quantity you
    want at one coordinate of every dim is one to name in *at*; a quantity
    you want summed over a dim is one to declare summed, as an expression of
    its own.

        tolerance: How far past an edge a solve must reach, relative to the
            region's scale, to count as a vertex rather than as the solver's
            own noise; and how close to a bound a value must sit to count as
