"""The crossing into pandas and xarray: the door's frames as this lane's arrays.

The language's relation is a table over any number of dimensions, keyed by
any number of its columns. What this lane builds of it is the **single-valued
map**: one value column read at the key, so the map is one dense array over
the key's dimensions and a walk is an ``assign_coords`` and a ``groupby``, or
a vectorised ``sel``. A relation may carry several value columns and each is
its own array, since a call names the column it walks.
:func:`refuse_relations_the_lane_does_not_build` turns the rest away at the
lane's door, naming the relational lane, which builds every shape the language
admits.
