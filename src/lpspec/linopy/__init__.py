"""The linopy lane: a YAML spec built as a ``linopy.Model``.

Requires the ``[linopy]`` extra (linopy, xarray).

One language, two lanes: the same file either attaches relationally and solves
through :mod:`lpspec.api`, or is constructed here as a ``linopy.Model`` the
caller then owns. Both accept *exactly* the same language, which is what makes
the differential tests an oracle rather than a comparison of dialects.

Two functions — a producer and a reader — and both are **pure**: YAML goes in,
a model or a value comes out, and nothing is retained, which is why
:func:`expression` takes ``sources`` again rather than remembering what
:func:`build` saw::

    from lpspec import linopy as lpspec_linopy

    m = lpspec_linopy.build('spec.yaml', {...})
    m.solve(...)
    lpspec_linopy.expression(m, 'spec.yaml', 'co2', {...})

The same spec on the other lane, which streams::

    import lpspec as lps

    with lps.solve('spec.yaml', {...}) as result:
        result.primal('p')

**Importing this module sets** ``linopy.options['semantics'] = 'v1'``. This
lane speaks v1 and the option is global: linopy's ``legacy`` default fills every
absent slot with 0, where the relational lane drops the row, so left alone the
two lanes answer the same YAML with different numbers. linopy's own context
manager cannot scope it — its ``__exit__`` resets *every* option to its default
rather than its prior value.
