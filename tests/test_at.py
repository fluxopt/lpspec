"""``at()`` — the pullback, and the models that had no formulation without it.

`sum` walks a mapping table from the fine dim into the coarse one; this
walks it back out. They take the same one argument on purpose: ``by=`` names
one lookup, and the helper says which direction.

Two things are checked here that a single-lane test could not reach.

**The answer, against the oracle.** A pullback duplicates a variable's label
across the fine dim, so the relational lane's key claim has to weaken and the
terminal aggregate has to run. Whether it does is only observable as a *wrong
objective*, which is what the differential case is for.

**The model the ledger cares about.** `examples/multi_period.yaml` is ragged —
four snapshots in 2030 against two in 2050 — which a ``period x snapshot``
rectangle cannot express at all. Its capacity bound reads a per-period
*variable* at every snapshot, and a variable cannot be pre-joined in data prep
the way a parameter can. The number `docs/examples/multi_period.md` quotes is
held by :func:`test_the_multi_period_page_number`.

    A minimum up time — a unit that starts must stay committed for its own *T*
    snapshots — is `sum(start over the last T) <= status`. Where *T* is fixed in
    the file that is a chain of shifts, a macro. Where each unit carries its
    own, the *number of terms* differs per unit and no chain can be written
    down, which the ledger read as the constraint being unsayable.

    It is not. The window is a relation between snapshots — one row per pair

    snapshot axis, the shape `pypsa_kvl` already uses for a cycle basis. The
    plan's *shape* is fixed before any data is read; only its cardinality comes
    from data, which is as true of `foreach: [snapshot]`.

    The mirror needs no second commitment variable and no identity table: `tf`
    maps back to `t` single-valuedly, which is a lookup, and `at()` reads the
    commitment onto the mirror axis where the start recurrence needs it.

    Two units, one with T=3 and one with T=1, and a no-load cost so idling is
    not free. The slow unit is cheaper to run, so it is chosen and must then

#: it rides on carries every dim the operand had. `u` is what makes that
#: difference observable: a shift along `t` reads the *other* dims off the
#: presence to place its edge, and there are two of them here where the frame
#: names one.

def test_a_pullbacks_absence_reaches_a_shift_that_spans_more_dims():
    """The shift edge places itself over dims the pullback's presence omits.

    A presence keyed by one column is the cheap spelling — materialising the
    coordinate product to name an edge costs a fifth of build on a wide ramp —
    and `edge: 0` is the one reader that goes looking for columns it may not
    have. It widens rather than asking, so this builds at all instead of
    failing on a column named `u`.

    Differential, and it is the case that decides both lanes read `edge:` the
    same way: an absence that arrived *before* the shift is not the edge, so it
    is not filled, and f3 — mapping nowhere — keeps no row at either t (#987).
