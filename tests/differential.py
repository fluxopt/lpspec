"""The both-lanes harness: one model, two backends, one answer.

The differential test is this project's central claim — the same YAML must
mean the same thing on the eager linopy lane and on the streaming relational
one (docs/about/architecture.md, hard rule 3). Twelve tests made that claim by hand, in
seven files, each rebuilding the same fifteen lines: build eagerly, solve,
take the objective, re-parse the schema, lower it, attach sources, execute,
compare.

What the repetition cost was not correctness but *evenness*. Every copy
compared objectives and checked the status, but only five of the twelve also
wrote the LP file and re-solved it, and nothing recorded why the other seven
skipped that third opinion — so the strength of the claim varied with which
file you happened to be reading. Here it is one ``lp=True``, and a test that
does not ask for it is visibly choosing not to.

Importing this module is the ``[linopy]`` guard: it reaches the oracle
through ``tests.oracle``, so a bare install skips every module that uses the
harness at collection time, with no filename list to maintain.

Usage — the engine stays open for the length of the ``with`` block, so
per-variable primal checks live inside it::

    with differential(NONCONVEX_YAML, sources, lp=True) as run:
        assert run.result.to_pandas('op_cost') ...

    ``spec`` is a ``Path`` to a file, the YAML text itself, or a raw dict —
    the eager lane only takes paths, so text and dicts are written to a
    temporary file here rather than in every caller.

    **Duals are not compared here, and cannot be.** An LP with alternative
    optima has many optimal dual solutions, and the two lanes hand HiGHS the
    same rows in a different order, so it lands on a different basis:
    ``genx_piecewise_fuel`` agrees on the objective to nine decimals, differs in
    2 of 72 entries of one primal, and in 12 of 48 entries of one dual. A
    lane-to-lane dual assertion would therefore be false rather than merely
    strict. What *is* checkable is a dual against a recording made from an
    instance designed to have a unique one, which is ``test_ports`` and
    ``test_corpus_parity``'s job rather than this harness's.

    Set ``lp=True`` to also write and re-solve the LP file, the third opinion.
    HiGHS reads that file, so a model carrying ``sos:`` must not ask for it:
    HiGHS has no SOS concept and its parser refuses the section outright, which
    is the same fact ``reformulate_sos='auto'`` handles on the eager side — a
    no-op for every model that declares no set, and what lets the oracle solve
    one that does.
