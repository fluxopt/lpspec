"""The ``gurobi`` sink, against the sink that was already here.

Two sinks loading one :class:`Tables` must produce the same model, so
HiGHS is the oracle for Gurobi the way linopy is the oracle for the math: the
interesting assertions here are agreements, not values. Where a value *is*
asserted it comes from ``examples/ports/references.json`` — somebody else's
published optimum, which neither sink can talk the other into.

Every test skips without ``gurobipy``. It ships a size-limited licence in its
own wheel, which is what makes this runnable in CI at all, so the models here
stay small enough for it — a few hundred columns, where the limit is 2000. A
port that outgrows the licence is named in ``OVER_THE_GUROBI_LIMIT`` and
skipped rather than shrunk: the corpus is checked against somebody else's
optimum for the whole model, and half of one reaches no published number.
