"""`cases:` — one quantity, a value per region, on both.

The regions of a cased expression are disjoint and total before any data attaches,
so neither ranks them: each builds a region against that region's own mask
and adds the results. What the tests below hold is the three things that
follow, and each of them was wrong in a first cut of this feature:

* a region's value reaches the coordinates it claims, and only those;
* a region's **absence** stays inside it — an ``otherwise`` that shifts with no
  ``edge=`` has nothing at the first position, and must not unmake a row the
  other regions do cover;
* a region's data is required **where that region applies**, so a parameter
  standing for one region is not asked to cover the whole frame, and a hole
  inside the region it does stand for is still refused.

The last two are the pair that can silently disagree between the two, which
is why every case here runs through ``differential``.
