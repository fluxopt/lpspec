"""What the build reports about itself: omissions, timings, magnitudes, sparsity.

A diagnostic is a claim about a model the solver never sees. A row that lost
every term is not built, and saying so is the difference between a smaller
problem and a silently different one; a coefficient range is what turns "the
solver struggled" into a named block; a parameter short of its dimensions is
reported rather than judged, because whether the gap is a mistake is the
modeller's call and not the engine's.

They are gathered here rather than beside the assembly they measure because
that is the question a reader arrives with — *what does the build tell me* —
and because a report that survives the model being released is a property of
the report, not of the matrix.
