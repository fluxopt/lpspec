"""``sos:`` — one construct, three sinks, and one of them without the concept.

The claim has two halves and they need different oracles. That the *language*
means the same thing on both lanes is `differential`'s job as usual. That a
set **written out** (``Spec.expand()``) is the same feasible set as a set a
sink branches on is not something either lane can say, since both would be
reading the expansion: so the optimum is enumerated here (:func:`best`), which
is tractable because a set over four options has nine admissible shapes, and
asserted against every sink.

The model is purpose-built for that enumeration: two sites choosing among four
sizes, values and caps varying enough that SOS1, SOS2 and the unrestricted LP
all have *different* optima — a set that does not bind proves nothing about a
formulation of it.
