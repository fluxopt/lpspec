"""Two versions written down twice each. This is what keeps each pair equal.

ruff first. The version lives in ``pyproject.toml`` (``ruff==`` in the dev
group, which is what CI installs and runs) and again in
``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` (the ``ruff-pre-commit``
rev, which is what the hook installs into its own isolated environment).
Nothing makes them agree on its own.

Dependabot manages both, but in *separate* PRs — it groups within an ecosystem
and never across one, so a ruff release produces one PR against the dev group
and another against the hook rev. Merge either alone and the formatter that
runs on commit is a different version from the one that gates the branch. That
shows up as a commit that was clean locally and fails CI, or the reverse, and
the cause is two files nobody thought to read together.

So: fail here instead, on the merge that introduced the skew, naming both
files. The fix is always to land the other PR.

Then the dependency floors. ``[project.dependencies]`` declares each one as a
lower bound, and the ``floors`` pixi environment pins the same package to that
exact version — the environment the ``ci`` job runs the suite in to prove the
bound is real rather than decorative. The version is therefore written twice in
one file, and this is what stops the copies drifting: raise a floor and the pin
has to move with it, which is the whole of the fix.

A direct reference (``mathspec @ git+…``) is the exception and is excluded
from both sides: it is already exact, so there is no bound to prove, and the
repository it points at claims its own floors.
