"""What a ``where:`` may say about data beyond one comparison per parameter.

Three node kinds arrived together and each reduces something the frame does
not carry: a comparison of two expressions reads arithmetic, a count reduces a
dimension away, and a shift reads a predicate at the neighbouring coordinate.
Every one has two implementations — an array in the linopy lane, a query in the
streaming one — so each is asserted through the differential harness rather
than against either lane alone.

The masks are put on *variables* rather than on constraints so the claim is
visible in the answer: an admitted member is worth one in the objective, so
the optimum counts exactly the coordinates the mask keeps.
