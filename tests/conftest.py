"""Shared fixtures and schema helpers for lpspec tests.

Everything here is linopy-free *and pandas-free at import*, so it loads on a
bare install. On a bare install (no [linopy] extra) the eager/oracle modules
skip themselves: they reach the oracle through ``tests.oracle``, whose
``importorskip`` guard fires at collection. There is no list of filenames to
keep in sync here — a module that needs the extra says so by importing it. The
differential harness lives in ``tests.differential`` for the same reason:
importing it *is* the guard.

pandas follows the same discipline one level down. It is no longer a runtime
dependency (it ships with the ``[linopy]`` extra, for the oracle and for
``Result.to_pandas``), so a fixture that hands out pandas objects imports it in
its own body: requesting the fixture is what asks for the dependency, and the
bare job never requests it. ``dispatch_inputs`` and ``dispatch_frame_inputs``
are the same numbers in the two shapes — the oracle lane is pandas-native, the
engine is frame-native, and the module constants are the single source of both.
