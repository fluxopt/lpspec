"""The MPS sink writes the model the LP sink writes, in the format's own order.

MPS is column-major and LP is row-major, so the two files order the matrix
differently and only one of them can be checked by reading it: the claim under
test is therefore never "these bytes" but **"this is the same model"**, and
every check reaches an optimum through the written file and compares it against
the same model reached another way.

Reproducibility (#109) is pinned here for the LP sink's reason — a golden file
proves one write, and the failure mode is two writes of one model differing —
and so is chunk-invariance, this being the writer whose chunking walks the
sorted matrix rather than the built one.
