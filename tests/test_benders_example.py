"""The decomposition example must keep reaching the monolith, or it is not evidence.

`examples/benders/run.py` is the claim that specsolve can *express* Benders — four
files, cuts as data, no engine change. A claim like that is worth exactly as
much as the check behind it, so the check is the one the algorithm itself
provides: the decomposed answer has to equal the answer the monolith gives on
the same sources, and the run prints both.

Committed output rather than an assertion on a number, for the reason
`test_walkthrough.py` gives: a page that shows output is making a promise about
what a reader will see, and a diff is how that promise stays true. Regenerate
with ``--update-golden`` when the story legitimately changes.
