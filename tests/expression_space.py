"""Every expression up to a bounded depth, and the rewrites that must not move it.

The AST is closed, which is what makes this different from sampling: at depth
three over two dimensions the space of spellings is *finite*, so the sweep in
``test_expression_sweep.py`` makes the strong claim — every one of them means
the same on both — rather than "a hundred did".

**Built well-formed, not filtered.** Each node carries the dimensions and the
degree it produces, and the constructors that can fail refuse what the language
would refuse: summing over a dimension the operand does not carry, a product
past degree two. Trial-loading the candidates instead cost twenty seconds of
collection, in every xdist worker, and turned a genuine load error into one more
rejected candidate. Here a load error is a failure.

**Rewrites are built, not found.** Depth bounds expression *size*, and the rules
worth checking need a *shape* — which gets rarer as the space grows, not
commoner. Enumerating to depth three and collecting the rules that happened to
fire yielded 3,824 commutativity pairs, which ``test_arithmetic_laws.py``
already states by hand, and ten of ``reduction-is-linear``, which is the one the
sweep exists for (#1203). So the rule-carrying shapes are constructed over an
operand pool instead — one builder per rule, below — and the two commute rules
are left to the curated file.

``reduction-is-linear`` is the rule with a side condition: ``sum(a + b)`` and
``sum(a) + sum(b)`` are equal only while every operand is *total*, and the
divergence when they are not went unnoticed for as long as the oracle shared it
(#311). The condition is read off the tree rather than assumed.

**A degree-two node is generated only as an operand, never emitted as a
case.** linopy refuses a quadratic constraint outright (#942), and
every case here is a constraint row, so a degree-two expression would make the
sweep report a lane limit it already knows about.
