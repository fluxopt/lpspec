"""The math a page prints for GitHub has to reach MathJax on the site as well.

``math_spec.to_markdown`` writes GitHub-flavoured Markdown, and its inline math
is the verbatim pair ``$`…`$`` — delimiters GitHub hands to MathJax untouched.
Arithmatex reads neither that pair nor a ```math fence. The fence is a
``superfences`` entry in ``mkdocs.yml`` and the pair is
``tools.mdx_github_math``, so a page rendering its equations as literal
backticks is what either of those going missing looks like — silently, on a
strict build, across sixty pages of generated models.

Nothing asked this before the site moved to zensical. The rewrite was a hook,
which only a full build could load; it is a Markdown extension now, which is
what lets the two assertions below run in a second.
