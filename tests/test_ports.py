"""Referenced models, checked against an optimum that did not come from lpspec.

Every other test here compares lpspec against lpspec. Even the differential
harness compares two lanes consuming the *same resolved AST* (hard rule 1), so
a **shared misreading** — both agreeing on a meaning the modeller did not
intend — passes the whole suite green. This is the net for that class.

Each expected objective was published with the model, produced by somebody
else's code, or — for the teaching models — reached by a hand-written
formulation on another modelling stack; ``examples/ports/references/`` holds
the scripts, run out of band, and ``references.json`` records what they said.
So the corpus needs no oracle and no extra dependency: it is linopy-free and
pandas-free, and runs on the bare-install job. See docs/examples/index.md; the
gallery page for each referenced model is asserted against its model file by
``test_models_gallery.py``.
