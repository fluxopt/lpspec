"""``sum(x, by=[l, m])`` — one grouping through several maps at once.

The single-lookup form lands terms on one dimension; this lands them on a
product of dimensions, which is what a capacity limit per *location and
technology* asks for. PyPSA ships exactly that as a constraint type
(`tech_capacity_expansion_limit`, carrier and bus together), so the shape has
an outside consumer rather than only a symmetry argument.

What needs two lanes to see:

**The grouping is one join, not two.** Relationally the coordinates ride the
same dim table, so a list costs one extra column and no extra join — held by
the lowering test, which asserts a single ``GroupSum`` carrying both names
rather than a composition.

**The empty combination.** A (bus, technology) pair no generator sits on is a
group with no members, and the two reach it by different routes: the
relational lane never emits a row, linopy's unstacked groupby invents
one and fills it with linopy's own ``const: nan``. That NaN does not stay in
the empty sum — it propagates through whatever the row adds next and takes the
whole row with it, which is why the row here carries a second term.

**Label order.** A groupby hands its groups back sorted; the dim table keeps
the declared order. Under v1 arithmetic a shared dim ordered two ways is a
refusal, so ``test_a_declared_order_the_groupby_would_not_pick`` builds the
model whose technologies are deliberately not alphabetical.
