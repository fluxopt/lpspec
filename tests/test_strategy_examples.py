"""The two `solve_over` examples must keep making their claims, or they are not evidence.

`examples/rolling/` and `examples/myopic/` are the two coupled strategies —
windows over one dimension, and periods that hand a fleet forward. Each is a
claim that the driver composes into the thing people actually run, and a claim
is worth what the check behind it is worth. So each has one *substantive*
assertion here, apart from its golden:

- rolling: lookahead really does close the myopia gap, and enough of it reaches
  full foresight exactly
- myopic: the fleet each period starts from is the one the last period ended
  with, which is the promise `carry` makes

Committed output for the rest, for the reason `test_benders_example.py` gives:
a page that shows output is promising what a reader will see, and a diff is how
that promise stays true. Regenerate with ``--update-golden``.

The scenario sweep has no example of its own — it is the uncoupled case, so
`docs/reference/sweeps.md`'s three lines are the whole of it and there is nothing an example
would add.
