"""Degree 1, checked against the oracle lane itself.

The ceiling's own inventory is math-spec's and is swept there; the relational
lane relaying a refusal to a caller is `test_language_boundary.py`. This module
checks the thing that actually mattered: that the *eager* lane refuses it too,
**in the same words**.

The rule lives in ``math_spec.degree`` and this lane asks it. Where it kept a
hand-copy of the ``**`` sentence instead, no test compared the copy against the
original; and for ``x * y`` it did not refuse at all — it multiplied and let
linopy raise whatever linopy raises, so the user got a library's error instead
of the language's, with no mention of ``piecewise:``. Hard rule 3 says both
lanes accept exactly the same language; a shared *set* with two different
refusals is the weakest possible version of that.
