"""The certificate an infeasible solve leaves, and the one convention the sinks sign it with.

``dual_ray`` is the only reader that answers on an infeasible solve, and it
exists so that a Benders driver can cut off a first-stage decision without a
second model standing in for the ray — which is what ``examples/benders/``
carried until it had one.

Every sink is asked the same question here, because the value of one convention
is that a driver never asks who solved: HiGHS and Xpress sign a row the way the
row is written, Gurobi signs it the other way and the sink negates, and the
three have to come back indistinguishable.
