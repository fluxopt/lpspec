"""piecewise costs: the λ-formulation block, and the epigraph that needs none.

The ``piecewise:`` expansion runs before either backend, so eager and
relational receive identical affine declarations. Nonconvex correctness is
verified by checking the linked primals lie ON the curve (adjacency binaries
at work) against a numpy interpolation; the ``convex:`` flag is verified to
produce the hull instead.

The last section is the counterweight, and the piecewise rules' claim: convex piecewise
needs no formulation machinery at all. Written as epigraph constraints it is
ordinary affine YAML, relational-eligible with no ``piecewise:`` block in
sight — which is the reason the block is only for the nonconvex case.
