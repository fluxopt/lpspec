"""The assertion-message rule, checked rather than reviewed.

AGENTS.md asks for the claim in the message that prints. Reviewed by eye that
held at 59% of the 1,583 assertions here, and the distribution said age rather
than disagreement — 5% in the oldest file, 96% in the newest. A rule at 59% with
no way to say whether that is bad is unenforceable in both directions.

**100% is the wrong target.** ``assert result.status == 'optimal'`` needs no
sentence, and demanding one produces exactly the restatement AGENTS.md tells you
to cut. So the rule checked here is narrower than the one written there, and
covers only assertions whose *claim is not visible in the expression*:

- **a literal collection** — ``== ['high', 'low', 'mid']`` claims an order and a
  completeness, and neither is on the line;
- **a count** — ``len(rows) == 4`` never says why four;
- **a tolerance** — ``approx(x, rel=1e-9)`` is a chosen precision;
- **an absence** — ``assert not offenders`` says what is empty, never why it
  must be.

**A ceiling, not a floor, and not a backfill.** 247 assertions were in breach
when this landed, and adding 247 sentences in one pass would produce 247
restatements rather than 247 claims. So the number is pinned: a new one turns
the suite red, and the count comes down as the files are touched for other
reasons. It is the same instrument the expression sweep's lane-refusal ceiling
is, for the same reason — a rule nobody can measure is a rule that drifts.
