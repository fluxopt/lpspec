"""Absence: what a missing value does to a coefficient, a row and a bound.

Absence is a first-class state here rather than a zero
(docs/reference/language/absence.md), and almost every rule in this file is a
consequence of that one decision: a sparse coefficient is still a coefficient,
a constant side with a hole is refused rather than filled, an empty group is a
zero and not a gap, and a term whose variable is absent takes its row with it.

The pairs matter more than the singles. A sparse coefficient and a sparse
*constant* are the same shape of data and are treated differently on purpose,
and an empty group is a zero while a member with no value is a refusal — so
they are checked next to each other, where the line between them is visible.
