"""Every referenced model, built on both.

``test_ports.py`` asks whether the relational lane reaches an optimum somebody
else published. This module asks the second question of the same corpus —
whether linopy builds the same model from the same file — and it is the same corpus
because the data is already there: ``port_sources`` hands both the same
tidy frames, so a model added to ``references.json`` is swept here the day it
lands rather than when someone remembers a glob.

Per model the claim is the strong one, three routes at once: linopy's
objective, this engine's, and the objective HiGHS reaches re-reading
the written LP file. ``test_ports.py`` supplies the fourth from outside, so a
model green in both modules has agreed with a published optimum four ways.

Importing ``tests.differential`` is the ``[linopy]`` guard, which is why this is
a module of its own rather than three more tests in ``test_ports.py``: that one
is linopy-free and pandas-free on purpose, and runs on the bare-install job.
