"""What an objective sums, when its terms do not carry the same dims.

An objective is one number and says so: the expression is scalar or the file
does not load, so every reduction in it is one somebody wrote. What these
tests hold is that the two readings a bracket allows are **both sayable and
different** — ``sum(a) + sum(b)`` totals each term over its own dims, while
``sum(a + b)`` broadcasts and counts each once per coordinate of the other.

That distinction is invisible while every term of an objective has the same
dims, which is every model the rest of the suite builds. It becomes an 8x
error the moment an objective spans a sparse ``(snapshot, node, tech)``
variable and a dense ``(snapshot, node, carrier)`` one — the shape a real cost
function has, and the shape that found #197. What #197 fixed by *rule* — the
implied sum distributing over addition — is now spelled at the call site, and
#1069 is why: the rule was invisible in the file and the math block disagreed
with the LP about it (#1046).
