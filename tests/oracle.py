"""Guarded access to the linopy lane, used as the differential oracle.

Importing this module skips the importing test module when the ``[linopy]``
extra is absent — ``pytest.importorskip`` raises ``Skipped``, and pytest turns
that into a skipped module at collection time.

Import the oracle *through here* rather than importing linopy or xarray
directly, so the guard cannot be bypassed by import ordering: isort sorts a
bare ``import xarray`` above a first-party import, and it would then blow up
as a collection error before any guard ran.

**pandas is re-exported for the same reason.** It is no longer a runtime
dependency — it ships with the ``[linopy]`` extra, for the oracle and for
``Result.to_pandas`` — so a bare ``import pandas as pd`` in a test module is
exactly the ordering bug described above, one dependency down. Test modules
take ``pd`` from here instead, and the guard covers it.

This replaces a hand-maintained list of filenames in ``conftest.py``, which
had to be edited every time a test module was added and silently mis-skipped
when it was not.

**The oracle is v1, and only v1.** A differential test is an oracle only if the
thing it compares against is the convention we implement. Legacy is the one
linopy is retiring: it fills every absent slot with 0, so it agrees with a lane
that keeps a constraint row whose variable is masked, and disagrees with one
that drops it. Measuring against legacy would pin this package to the behaviour
v1 classifies as a bug (PyPSA/linopy#712). So the guard below raises rather
than skipping — a skip would be the worst outcome available, the suite going
green having quietly stopped checking the lanes against each other on precisely
the cases the convention changed.

The lane is imported under its own name rather than something shorter, because
this module re-exports the *real* ``linopy`` too: ``specsolve_linopy`` names the
module it actually is, and cannot be confused with it.
