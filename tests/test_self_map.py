"""A relation whose two columns sit over one dimension — a representative snapshot.

`rep_of: {key: snapshot, values: {rep: snapshot}}` maps each
snapshot to the one that stands for it. The language's own example of the form,
and two columns keyed by one, so `lanes.lowered` takes it.

What needs two lanes to see: the walk lands on the dimension it started from, so
the column it produces and the column it was joined on are over one dimension —
and a frame, or an array's coordinate, has one name per dimension to give them.
