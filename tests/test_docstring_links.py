"""Every link a docstring in `src/` writes lands on a specsolve object.

The strict site build checks the links of the docstrings it renders, which is
the public surface. Most links sit in modules the site never renders, where a
target that was renamed or removed leaves a link to nothing and no build
notices. This walks every docstring the package holds, resolves each link the
way the site does — in the docstring's own scope, walking outward — and
refuses one that lands nowhere, or on another package, whose names are plain
code rather than links.

griffe is the site's own reader, loaded with the extension the site uses to read
`#:` attribute comments, and ships with the docs toolchain: this runs under
`pixi run docs-test` and skips where the toolchain is absent.
