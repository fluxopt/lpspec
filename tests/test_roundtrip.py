"""``Spec.to_yaml`` gives back the same model — held over the whole corpus.

The method is three lines; **this file is the deliverable**. A `to_yaml` that
drifts from what the engine builds is worse than none: a reviewer would be
reading a model that never ran, and nothing about the output would look wrong.

The ways it could drift are all quiet. A field gaining a default, a validator
normalising a value, an alias, a dict that stops preserving order — each turns
the dumped file into a *different* model while every existing test still
passes, because every existing test builds from the original.

So the property is checked against the corpus rather than a fixture: every
example and every ported model, which between them exercise every construct the
language has (`docs/examples/index.md` generates the coverage table from exactly
this set).
