"""Re-solving one built model with new numbers.

Two claims, and the first is the whole contract: **an update answers what a
fresh build answers**. `build(spec, sources | change)` is always available as
the reference, so every rung below is checked against it rather than against a
number someone wrote down — the same oracle shape as the two-lane differential
and the Benders monolith check.

The second is that the fast path is *only* a fast path. An update that moves a
mask renumbers labels and cannot be pushed onto a loaded solver, so the engine
rebuilds and solves cold; nothing about the answer changes, and
`diagnostics().loads` is where a driver finds out which happened.
