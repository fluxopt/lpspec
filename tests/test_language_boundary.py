"""The streaming language boundary: out-of-subset constructs are load errors.

There is no runtime fallback — the streaming subset IS the language
(docs/about/architecture.md), and both lanes are inside it: `lpspec.linopy`
builds the same file through the same `to_program` gate.
Errors must carry the construct and its context, verbatim.
