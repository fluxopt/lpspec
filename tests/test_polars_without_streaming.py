"""A polars built without the streaming engine, such as the browser's, still solves and reads back.

polars' Pyodide build refuses ``collect(engine='streaming')`` with a pyo3 panic,
which is a ``BaseException`` rather than an ``Exception``, so a caller that
asked for the engine by name fell over at the first parameter it attached.
The engine is now asked for once, and a refusal chooses the in-memory one.
