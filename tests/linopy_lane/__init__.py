"""The linopy lane: a YAML spec built as a ``linopy.Model``, the differential-test oracle.

A test dependency, not part of the package: linopy and xarray come with the
``dev`` group, and nothing under ``src/`` imports this.

One language, two lanes: the same file either attaches relationally and solves
through :mod:`specsolve.api`, or is constructed here as a ``linopy.Model``.
Both accept *exactly* the same language, which is what makes the differential
tests an oracle rather than a comparison of dialects.

Two functions — a producer and a reader — and both are **pure**: YAML goes in,
a model or a value comes out, and nothing is retained. :func:`evaluate` takes
``sources`` again rather than remembering what :func:`build` saw::

    from tests import linopy_lane as specsolve_linopy

    m = specsolve_linopy.build('spec.yaml', {...})
    m.solve(...)
    specsolve_linopy.evaluate(m, 'spec.yaml', 'co2', {...})  # a name the file declares
    specsolve_linopy.evaluate(m, 'spec.yaml', 'sum(p * rate)', {...})  # one it never did

The same spec on the other lane, which streams::

    import specsolve as sps

    with sps.solve('spec.yaml', {...}) as result:
        result.primal('p')

**Importing this module sets** ``linopy.options['semantics'] = 'v1'``. This
lane speaks v1 and the option is global: linopy's ``legacy`` default fills every
absent slot with 0, where the relational lane drops the row, so left alone the
two lanes answer the same YAML with different numbers. linopy's own context
manager cannot scope it — its ``__exit__`` resets *every* option to its default
rather than its prior value.
