"""`check(spec, sink=...)`: the second axis, asked with no data attached.

Whether a model is *sayable* is solver-independent; where it can *land* is not.
What is pinned here is what makes that a separate argument rather than a
warning everyone gets: bare `check` stays silent, the answer needs no data and
no installed solver, and a refusal names the sinks that would have taken it.
