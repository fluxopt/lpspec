"""The notebook pages must keep running, and keep claiming true things.

``docs/interactive.ipynb`` teaches the three loops a session actually has —
update, grow a coordinate set, patch the spec — plus the verb that reads a built
row back when one of them lands wrong, and ``docs/lifecycle.ipynb``
aims them at linopy's `fix` / `relax` / `remove`. Every cell is a real call, so a
signature change breaks this test rather than leaving a page that reads fine and
errors in a reader's kernel.

Running is the weaker half, as with ``test_walkthrough.py``. The prose also
*claims* things: that the update loop loaded one model for three solves, that
growing an axis loads a second, that a pin moves bounds rather than labels,
that a masked-out generator leaves the balance row a term short. A
page that executed but had stopped doing any of that would still be green here
without these assertions, and would teach the wrong loop.

Cells are exec'd in order in one namespace rather than run through a kernel:
the property under test is that the notebook works top to bottom, and a kernel
would add jupyter_client and ipykernel to the dev group to prove the same thing.
The site does run it on one — ``execute: true`` in mkdocs.yml — so a build is
the second place this would fail, several minutes later and only on a push.
