"""``model.row`` — the verb for *this row is wrong and I do not know why*.

`typeset` renders the model as math before any data, and `Result.dual` gives a
row's number without its terms. Neither answers what a named row at a named
coordinate actually says, which is the question a model with a hundred thousand
rows is debugged by.

The claim that makes it worth having is that it reads the **built** row and not
the declared one: a coefficient that data scaled, a term whose variable was
absent, a row a ``where`` removed. Every test here is a case where the file and
the built row differ, because a reader that only agrees with the file would be
`typeset` with extra steps.
