``CHANGELOG.md`` is edited by hand. Above the first release sits at most one
``## Upcoming version``. A release PR renames it to ``## 0.1.0 (2026-10-01)``,
and the merge to ``main`` releases the first version heading that has no tag.
Only the heading lines are read; the prose under them is the release notes as
written. Standard library only, because the release workflow runs it on the
runner's own Python.
