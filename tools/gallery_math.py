"""Each gallery page's math, generated from the model the page shows.

    pixi run python -m tools.gallery_math           # rewrite every page's math block
    pixi run python -m tools.gallery_math --check   # fail if any has drifted

A page that states its model's math by hand is the same shape of claim as a
hand-kept coverage table: written once when it was true, with nothing failing
when the model changes underneath it. That is not hypothetical here — three
pages had already drifted when this was written, and the drift was in the
direction that matters, the page claiming *less* constraint than the model
builds:

- ``dispatch`` displayed a bound for every ``(s, g)`` while the model masks
  with ``where: "p_max > 0"`` — the very line the prose underneath calls the
  one worth pausing on;
- ``storage`` wrote ``\\eta\\,\\mathrm{charge}_s`` for a parameter the model
  does not have, having hardcoded ``0.9``;
- ``transport`` wrote ``\\sum_{g \\in \\mathrm{bus}}``, which is not
  well-formed — ``bus`` is a coordinate map, not a set.

The hand-written one-liner stays: it is a *summary*, and a good one, doing a
job the generated block does not. What is generated is the exact statement
underneath it, which is the thing that has to be true.

Notation comes from ``examples/symbols/<model>.yaml`` where one exists, so a
page keeps the symbols its prose already uses; models without a table get the
derived symbols, which are plain but never ambiguous.

The toggle is ``<details markdown="1">``, and every part of that is load
bearing, because these pages are read in two renderers.

On **GitHub**: the sanitiser strips ``<style>``, ``class``, ``onclick`` and a
bare ``<input>``, so the CSS-only tab trick cannot survive it — ``<details>``
and math inside it both do. Unknown attributes are dropped, so ``markdown="1"``
costs nothing there.

On the **site**: ``md_in_html`` is enabled, and without ``markdown="1"`` it
treats everything inside the element as raw HTML — the tables and the ``$$``
blocks render as literal text. The strict build does not catch that, because
literal text is valid; ``tests/test_docs_site.py`` does.

``pymdownx.tabbed`` is enabled, so real tabs are now available — but a
``=== "Math"`` marker is literal text on GitHub, and mkdocs.yml is explicit
that these pages are meant to render in both places. If that ever stops being
true, tabs are a change to :func:`_block` and to nothing else, which is the
reason to generate this rather than hand-write it even once.

``docs/index.md`` is the exception, and gets :func:`_home_block`: it is the one
page under ``docs/`` that is *only* ever the site — ``README.md`` is what
GitHub renders for the repo — so its block does use tabs, and shows the LaTeX
source beside the math it sets. Same model, same generation, different marker
(``home-math:``) because it is a different rendering of it.
