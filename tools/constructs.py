"""The gallery's catalogue and its two evidence tables: which models there are,
what each exercises, and what somebody else says its answer is.

    pixi run python -m tools.constructs           # rewrite all three blocks
    pixi run python -m tools.constructs --check   # fail if any has drifted

The point of generating them is that a hand-kept table is the exact shape of
claim that rots: it is written once when it is true, and nothing fails when a
model changes underneath it. ``tests/test_models_gallery.py`` asserts the
committed blocks equal what this produces.

**The catalogue** is read off ``mkdocs.yml``'s nav and each page's own opening
line, so the list on the page and the list in the sidebar are one list. The nav
is already the complete one — ``strict: true`` with ``nav.omitted_files: warn``
fails the build on a page missing from it — which is what lets the section head
say *every* model. The hand-kept version it replaced had drifted to sixteen of
twenty-three.

**Constructs** are read off the **logical plan**, not the YAML text. Grepping
for ``shift(`` would count a construct inside a macro that never expands, miss
one a macro introduces, and disagree with itself about whether a bound written
as ``0`` is a bound. ``to_program`` needs no data, so the plan is available
for any model in the repo — and it is what the engine actually builds.

**References** are read off ``examples/ports/references.json``, which is the
same file ``tests/test_ports.py`` asserts against. That is the whole point: a
published optimum and an asserted optimum that can disagree is a correctness
claim with nothing behind it. Adding a port is a JSON entry and a regenerate.
