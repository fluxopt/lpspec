"""Delete a guard, run the tests, and record whether anything went red.

A *mutation table* is what AGENTS.md asks for beside a correctness guard: delete
the guard, run the suite, and write down whether it was caught. A guard the
suite survives is one no test can reach, and the table is the evidence that each
one is reachable — which a green suite, on its own, never is.

Run by hand that table can lie three ways, and each of the three is a run that
happened here:

**A stale ``__pycache__`` keeps the mutant running after it was restored.** The
staleness check is mtime plus size, so a same-length patch put back inside the
same second leaves the interpreter on the old bytecode, and the *next* mutation
measures a tree nobody is looking at.

**A restore held in a variable leaves the mutant in the tree.** A run killed by
a timeout or a Ctrl-C never reaches its ``finally``; #974 committed a mutated
sink that way, and the following run read it as the baseline.

**Uncommitted work has nothing to restore to.** ``git checkout --`` puts back
what was committed, so an edit that was never committed would be destroyed
rather than restored. Untracked files are not at risk and are not counted.

So this refuses to start unless every tracked file is committed, restores each with
``git checkout --`` rather than from memory, drops ``__pycache__`` on both sides
of every mutation, and ends by asserting the tree is clean again — printed, so a
reader of the output knows it was checked.

Rows print as they finish, so a killed run still leaves the ones it got through.
For the two-column form — the same mutations against a base branch — run the
tool once in each worktree and put the columns side by side; nothing here needs
to know about the other branch.
