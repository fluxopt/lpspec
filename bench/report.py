"""Turn a results JSONL into the markdown that goes in docs/about/benchmarks.md.

Nothing here recomputes or smooths anything: repeats collapse by *minimum*,
which is the usual choice for a benchmark because noise only ever adds. The
point of this module existing at all is that the published table has one
provenance — a file — instead of being retyped by hand and then outliving the
harness that produced it.

What it does add is a doubt. A minimum whose rounds all ran slow looks exactly
like a clean one, and one such cell was 2.33x wrong before anyone noticed
(#797) — so a cell whose spread exceeds `SPREAD_BUDGET` is marked. The number
printed is still the minimum; the mark is what says not to quote it.
