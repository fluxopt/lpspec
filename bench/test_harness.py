    The guards above check that a name is present and that linopy's branch is
    written down as a commit. Neither compares a pin to the run it exists to
    reproduce, so the page went on documenting
    `uv run --locked bench/reproduce.py` while the lock named
    `v0.0.1-alpha.258` and the numbers printed beside it were taken twenty-six
    alphas later — through a lowering pass that release did not have (#1490).

    A published file records the versions it was measured on, so the run says
    what the lock has to name and this cannot be kept true by hand.

    **Read from git, not from `bench/results/`.** `pytest bench` collects this
    file, so this runs *inside* a measuring run — which clears the committed
    results before it measures and then writes its own, newer than any lock a
    published number could have. Reading the directory therefore fails every
    case of a published run: first on an empty directory, then on the versions
    the run is in the middle of producing. What is committed at `HEAD` is what
    the page publishes, and it is what the lock has to match.
