"""`dispatch` as a matrix: one column block, one balance row per snapshot.

What a performance-minded user of either solver's bulk API writes, and the same
seam our own sinks reach. The difference between a matrix arm and ours is
therefore *where the matrix came from*, which is the only thing worth measuring
here.

The balance matrix is a block of ones per snapshot, which is
``kron(I(n_snapshot), ones(1, n_generator))`` — built once, in one call, rather
than assembled row by row.
