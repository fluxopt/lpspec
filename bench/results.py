"""pytest-benchmark JSON in, flat measurement records out.

`bench/report.py` and `bench/plot.py` render the published tables and the chart
page, and between them they are four hundred lines of formatting that has been
read against the numbers it prints. When the harness became pytest, the cheap
and safe move was to leave every one of those lines alone and change only what
feeds them — so this module speaks the record shape they already read:

    {'record': 'timing', 'case', 'size', 'arm', 'sink', 'phase',
     'wall_seconds', 'fastest_seconds', 'q1_seconds', 'q3_seconds', 'iqr', 'median', 'rounds',
     'peak_rss_bytes', 'peak_bytes', 'allocations',
     'counts': {...}, 'live_fraction'}
    {'record': 'loop',   'case', 'size', 'arm',
     'first_build_seconds', 'steady_build_seconds'}
    {'record': 'run',    'platform', 'machine', 'cpu', 'cores', 'python', 'versions', 'commits'}
    {'record': 'ceiling','case', 'size', 'sink', 'arm', 'ladder', 'budget', 'memory_budget',
     'stopped_by', 'reason'}

**Where each number comes from.** ``wall_seconds`` is pytest-benchmark's own
``median`` — and it used to be ``min``, on the rule that noise only ever adds.
That rule is right for A/B-ing one engine against itself, where both sides get
the same treatment. It is wrong for a table comparing libraries, twice over:

- **The minimum is a best-of-n and n is not equal.** pytest-benchmark calibrates
  by duration, so a fast cell here took 84 rounds and a slow one took 9. The
  expected minimum of 84 draws is not the expected minimum of 9.
- **The mean is worse.** These distributions have a right tail that belongs to
  the machine rather than to the library: one round in forty of a 20 ms
  measurement took 1.5 s, which drags its mean to 2.9x its median. One
  scheduler hiccup should not set a published number.

The median needs five bad rounds out of nine to move, which is no longer a
hiccup. ``fastest_seconds`` keeps the old number beside it. ``peak_rss_bytes`` is the minimum
of pytest-benchmem's ``rss_bytes`` series, the whole-process high-water mark it
records under ``benchmem(isolate=True)`` and the only memory number honest
across two libraries (see `bench/test_ladder.py`). ``first`` and ``steady`` are
read off the per-round series: round 0 is the cold build, and the minimum of
the rest is what a rolling horizon pays.

``q1_seconds`` and ``q3_seconds`` are the middle half of the same rounds, and
they are what the chart page draws as a band. Not min to max: one nine-round
measurement here read
``[1.18, 1.02, 1.07, 1.02, 1.02, 1.02, 1.06, 1.45, 9.97]``, so its envelope
would have been a single outlying round drawn ten times the height of the
model it belongs to. The quartiles say where the work actually sits, and a
band that overlaps another line's is two numbers this run cannot tell apart.

**The distribution rides along with the minimum.** ``iqr``, ``median`` and
``rounds`` are carried so the report can say whether a published minimum is
trustworthy: a run whose every round was slow prints a clean-looking minimum
and nothing else in the record contradicts it (#797). They are a quality
signal, not a second headline — and ``iqr`` over ``median`` is now a ratio of
the same distribution the tables publish, which it was not while they printed
the minimum.

**The record names the machine, because the ladder no longer runs on one.**
``cpu`` is pytest-benchmark's ``machine_info.cpu.brand_raw`` and ``cores`` its
count — collected all along, dropped here in favour of ``platform.processor()``,
which answers ``x86_64`` on every Linux box there is. The sinks measure in
separate jobs (#1315) and a runner pool mixes CPU models, so without these two
a merged table prints one provenance line for rows taken on two machines.

**A cell nobody measured is a result too.** A library the time budget stopped
leaves no benchmark entry at all, so its ceiling rides in a `.ceilings.json`
beside the measurements and comes back as a `ceiling` record. Without it the
tables print one em dash for *too slow to measure* and the same em dash for
*this library has no HiGHS*, which are different answers.

**One thing the old runner did that this does not: record a failure as a
result.** It caught a child that died, kept the exception line, and the report
rendered it as a cell — which is how `docs/about/benchmarks.md` publishes that the
linopy lane runs out of memory at a rung the relational one survives. Under
pytest a dead pass is an error, and a real OOM kills the process before
anything in it can record why. The readers still understand an ``error`` record
and will render one; nothing produces it yet. Until that is resolved, the top
rung is a claim made by a run that failed rather than by a table.
