"""Re-run the published comparison on the versions that produced it.

    uv run --locked bench/reproduce.py            # the published selection
    uv run --locked bench/reproduce.py --sizes xs # a smaller look

**Why this file exists at all.** `pixi.lock` is not committed, and two of the
libraries the benchmark measures are installed from git — lpspec itself, and
linopy from `master`, a branch that moves. So "the versions that produced a
number" was recorded only inside the results file, after the fact, in a form
nobody could install. `bench/reproduce.py.lock` beside this script freezes every
one of them, git commits included, and `--locked` refuses to run if the
resolution has drifted.

**It reads the selection rather than repeating it.** `pixi run ladder` in
`pyproject.toml` is where the cases, rungs, sinks and libraries are written
down; this script pulls that string out of the manifest, so a reproduction
cannot quietly run a different comparison than the one being reproduced.

**It drives the harness rather than repeating it.** The models, the data
generators and the rungs live in `bench/`; a standalone script that rebuilt them
would be a second definition of every model, free to disagree with the one being
measured. So this needs the repository checked out, which anyone reproducing a
number needs anyway — the rival formulations are in it.

**The published numbers predate this file and cannot be reproduced from it.**
They were taken against `lpspec 0.0.1a61.dev3+gf319cd10f` and a linopy built
from a branch, neither of which resolves from an index. That is the argument for
the lock rather than an objection to it: the next published run is taken through
this script, and then the pins and the page describe the same environment.
