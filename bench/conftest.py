"""The harness: selection, and the data every arm reads.

Every moving part is pytest's own: the case x size x sink x arm product is a
`parametrize`, isolation is `benchmem(isolate=True)`, repetition and its
minimum are pytest-benchmark's rounds, and the output is `--benchmark-json`.
Nothing here re-implements a runner.

**There is one arm, so there is no parity gate.** It compared the arms'
objectives at the smallest rung, which is a check with one counterparty — and
with one arm it has none. It returns with the second arm, where it means
something again; until then `bench.floor`'s ``--check`` is the only
same-model check here, and `test_ladder._record` is the arithmetic one that
runs on every measurement.

What is *not* free is the ragged shape: cases have different ladders, and the
density rungs exist on one case only. So the (case, size) axis is built here
rather than taken as a product — a missing rung is skipped, not an error, which
is what makes `--sizes all` and `--sizes d100 d50` both mean something.

**The two axes stay separate params.** `parametrize(('case_name', 'size'), ...)`
gives pytest-benchmem two scalar dims to group and plot by; packing them into
one string id would leave it nothing to read but the id, which it deliberately
does not parse.
