"""Every measurement as one long table — a row per number, and nothing wide.

`report.py` renders the published markdown and `plot.py` renders the chart
page's literal; both decide *in code* which cells exist, so a question nobody
anticipated — peak against nonzeros, one sink across cases, a new phase — is a
change to a renderer. This is the third rendering and the one with no opinions:
dims in columns, one metric per row, and whatever asks the question later does
its own pivot.

    run,case,size,sink,arm,phase,variables,metric,value
    latest,dispatch,l,highs,specsolve,emit,2000000,wall_seconds,0.83

**A missing number is an absent row, never a null.** A cell the run did not
produce — `peak_rss_bytes` without `isolate=True`, `nonzeros` on an arm whose
model cannot count them — writes nothing, so every value column is complete.
That is the same rule the language holds its own inputs to, and it is what
makes this file loadable by specsolve without a fillna.

**`phase` is why the shape is worth having.** Today it takes four values —
``emit`` for build-and-emit, ``window`` for a later window of a rolling horizon,
``first`` and ``steady`` for the two halves of the rebuild loop. A finer split
(import, ingest, build, emit, retrieve) adds values to that column and changes
no schema, no renderer and no committed file.

``window`` is the one the published tables do not render: `bench/report.py` and
`bench/plot.py` take the ``emit`` phase, so a rung measuring the same cell at a
different moment is reachable here and nowhere else — which is this file's own
argument for existing.

**The fingerprint is long too** (`--runs`): one row per fact, so a dependency
added to `TRACKED` in `bench/conftest.py` is a row rather than a column.
