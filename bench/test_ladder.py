"""The ladder: one model, two lanes, one seam — measured by whichever plugin is loaded.

    pixi run refresh    # every rung, then both writers, in order — or by hand:
    pixi run -e bench pytest bench --benchmark-memory --benchmark-json=bench/results/latest.json \\
        --sizes xs s m l
    pixi run -e bench python -m bench.report bench/results/latest.json    # -> markdown
    pixi run -e bench python -m bench.plot                                # -> the chart page

Selection is `--cases / --sizes / --arms / --sinks` (see `conftest.py`), so the
published ladder and a one-rung smoke test are the same command with different
flags — and `-k` narrows further without any of them.

**Peak RSS is the published metric, and it needs `isolate=True`.** It is a
property of a *process*: a second arm in the same interpreter inherits the
first's high-water mark and its warm allocator. `isolate=True` is what gives a
fresh process per pass, and with it the whole-process `rss` beside the memray
peak — the two measure different things and both are recorded, because
`docs/about/benchmarks.md` publishes a cross-library claim and only `rss` is honest
across libraries. memray counts polars' reserved arenas as allocated and does
not count the interpreter at all, so the same pair of runs is 0.51x by RSS and
0.07x by memray. Within one lane that bias cancels; across two it does not.

**What is not measured, deliberately:** solve time (that is HiGHS, identical
either way, and it would swamp the build) and anything about expressiveness.
