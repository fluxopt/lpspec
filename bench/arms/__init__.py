"""Every arm, and the four verbs the harness asks of one.

An *arm* is one library's answer to the same question: same parquet, same
model, same seam. The harness knows nothing about any of them beyond the names
below, so adding one is a module here and an entry in `ARMS` — not a branch in
the runner.

Each arm module defines:

    prepare(case_name, size, paths, options) -> Prepared
    build_and_emit(sink, prepared) -> Counts
    build_only(prepared) -> Counts
    objective(prepared) -> float

``Prepared`` is opaque to the harness: it hands the token from `prepare` to the
verb without looking inside, so an arm's own bookkeeping — validating paths,
resolving a writer backend — is described once and lands where it belongs.

**`prepare` is the pre-clock hook, and it is the reason it exists.** Whatever
an arm needs before it can build, that the *harness* rather than the library
imposed, is charged to nobody: the lpspec arm re-parses the case's YAML only
because the runner decides which parquet file is which, and the linopy arm has
no counterpart to be charged for it.

**Every verb is top-level and picklable**, because ``benchmem(isolate=True)``
sends it to a fresh process: peak RSS is a property of a process, and two
measurements in one interpreter report the larger of them twice.

**The library is imported inside the verb, never at module scope.** The import
is part of what an arm costs — a modelling library's alone can exceed lpspec's
entire build at the `xs` rung — so a harness that had already paid for it
before measuring would be charging one arm for another's work. That is also
why `ARMS` maps to modules rather than to imported callables.
