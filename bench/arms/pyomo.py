"""pyomo, hand-written — the incumbent, and the baseline most readers already have.

Slow is the expected answer and not the point. A comparison that leaves pyomo
out looks chosen, and a reader who runs pyomo today wants to know what the
difference is in the units this harness measures rather than in an anecdote.

**The model is a `ConcreteModel` with `Set`/`Var`/`Constraint` rules**, which is
what pyomo's own documentation and every textbook using it writes. Each case's
is in `bench/models/<case>/pyomo.py`.

**All three sinks, through appsi's persistent interfaces.** `set_instance`
populates the solver's own model and stops there, which is the same seam
`build_highs` and `build_gurobi` reach — no `solve()` anywhere near a
measurement. The LP writer is pyomo's own.

**`symbolic_solver_labels` is left off**, which is pyomo's default: the labels
it would otherwise generate are the same feature `set_names=False` switches off
on the linopy arm, and the default is already the cheap side. Nothing is
switched off here that pyomo does not switch off itself.

**The parquet is read with pandas.** pyomo's own examples build their
`initialize=` mappings out of dicts and pandas frames; a polars read would
charge it for a hop its users do not take.
