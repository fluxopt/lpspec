"""linopy, hand-written — the arm a reader means when they see the name.

Not the deleted `lpspec.linopy` lane: that read our YAML and measured our own
lowering on top of linopy's work, which is why it was retired here (#1268)
before it was deleted outright. Here the model is
typed out per case in `bench/models/<case>/linopy.py`, the way linopy's own
docs and this repo's `examples/ports/references/linopy/` write it — the same
scripts the gallery publishes, which is what makes this arm's formulations
reviewable rather than a strawman.

**The parquet is read with pandas**, not polars: linopy's inputs are pandas and
xarray, so a polars read plus a conversion would charge it for a hop its users
do not take. Each arm reads the way its own library expects.

**Three defaults are switched off, and they are load-bearing:**

- `set_names=False` on both solver hand-offs. linopy names every variable and
  constraint while our sinks name nothing, so the default would time a feature
  only one arm's model carries — naming is **82% of linopy's HiGHS hand-off**
  (0.11s against 0.02s at 200k variables) and 35% of its Gurobi one.
- `progress=False` on the LP writer. Its default is `m._xCounter > 10_000`, so
  every rung above `xs` renders tqdm bars no other arm draws — ~7% of the write
  at 10M variables, and stderr noise in a harness that parses stdout.
- `io_api='lp-polars'`, its fastest writer rather than its default one. The
  correction runs against us, which is the direction an honest harness errs in.
