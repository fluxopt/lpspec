"""gurobipy, both dialects — the model is hand-written, in `bench/models/<case>/`.

One runtime for two arms: `gurobipy-loop` and `gurobipy-matrix` differ only in
which formulation module they call, and everything around that call — reading
the parquet, the environment, the seam, the counts — is the same and belongs
here rather than twice in the models.

**The seam is `update()`, and it is inside the clock.** gurobipy defers every
`addVar` and `addConstr` until the model is flushed, so timing the calls alone
measures a queue and not a model. `build_gurobi` on our own arm ends with the
same call, which is what makes the two comparable.

**`OutputFlag` goes off at `Env` construction**, not after: set later, the
licence banner has already been written, and it lands inside the measurement.

**Counts are read after the clock stops** — touching `NumVars` forces the
update this arm has just paid for deliberately.

There is one sink. An LP file would measure Gurobi's writer rather than ours,
and this arm cannot reach HiGHS at all.
