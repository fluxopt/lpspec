"""Refresh the chart page's numbers.

    pixi run -e bench python -m bench.plot

The page is a tracked source file, not a build artifact: its markup, prose and
renderer are edited by hand and reviewed in the diff. Only the measurements go
stale, so this rewrites exactly one line of it — the ``const DATA = {...};``
literal — and touches nothing else. Templating the page instead would move the
interesting part (what the bands *say*) into a file nobody opens.

One panel per model and sink, one line per library, log on both axes — which is
the only shape that shows a *slope*, and the slope is the claim. A table can
say a library is behind at one size; only the curve says whether it is falling
further behind or catching up.

**The band around each line is that measurement's own rounds**, minimum to
maximum. It is not a confidence interval and not the spread across models: it
is what the machine did to the same work nine times over, so a line whose band
overlaps another's is two numbers this run cannot tell apart. `bench/report.py`
marks the same doubt with `~` where it exceeds a quarter of the median; here it
is drawn, which is the one thing a table cannot do.
