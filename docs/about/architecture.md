# Architecture

This page explains how the package is put together and why. Read it before you
change its structure, add a lane, sink or operator, or decide what may enter the
language.

Brief, current, precise. A PR that changes the structure described here updates
this file in the same PR. The language itself is
[the language reference](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/language/).
What may enter the language is
[the ceiling](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/ceiling/). Plans
and refusals are [the roadmap](roadmap.md). Measured results are
[the benchmarks](benchmarks.md), produced by the harness in
[bench/](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/blob/main/bench/README.md). That
harness is also how a claim on this page gets falsified.

`python examples/walkthrough.py` runs the pipeline below stage by stage and
prints what each stage produces. It makes the same public calls `lps.solve`
makes, so the demonstration cannot drift from the code. Its output is committed
as
[examples/walkthrough.out](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/blob/main/examples/walkthrough.out)
and asserted line for line by `tests/test_walkthrough.py`. Reading that file is
the same as running it. A stage that starts telling a different story shows up
as a diff in it.

A few nouns carry this page, and [the glossary](../reference/glossary.md) holds
their definitions. A *spec* is the model file as the language reads it, and a
*program* is the plan the spec lowers to. A *source* is one table of data,
attached under a declared parameter's name. A *frame* is a table in memory. A
*coordinate* is one row of a dimension product, one generator at one snapshot.
A *mask* is a `where:` condition that removes coordinates. A *sink* is where a
built model goes: a solver, or a file. A *model* is a built program with its
data attached, and a *result* is what a solve hands back. The package builds a
program along one of two *lanes*: the relational lane (`relational/`), which
streams a plan to a sink, and the linopy lane (`linopy/`), which builds a
`linopy.Model` eagerly.

## Thesis

A YAML math spec is a **closed AST known before any data is touched**. That
one property makes everything else legal. The whole model can be compiled two
ways: to eager xarray/linopy calls, or to a logical plan executed relationally
and streamed to a sink. Both paths provably mean the same thing. Every rule
below protects that property. A *declared* memory ceiling is not something the
package has; see [the memory axis](roadmap.md#where-it-is-going).

**The producer of the AST is a different package.** `math_spec` parses,
expands, resolves and judges a file, and this repository consumes what comes
out. So the widest fence in the drawing is not a directory rule at all. It is
`pyproject.toml`, and it is the amber box below, labelled math-spec. Everything
in that box, the typesetter included, is that one package. It depends on
nothing here and cannot import anything here. **Its passes are named in the box
and not drawn.** How a file becomes an AST is math-spec's architecture,
documented and tested there. A second copy of it here would be one more thing
to drift. What crosses is the waist, and the waist is the whole of what this
drawing needs of that package. The rest is two directories, one per lane. They
are fenced too, by rules `tests/test_architecture.py` reads off the path, so a
module cannot step over a fence by being spelled differently. But a fence is
not what a lane *is*. The rules are written out in the
[module map](#module-map) rather than repeated in the drawing.

**The dashed box is outside every fence, and that is the point.** `sources.py`
is the seam. It turns a caller's tables into the frames a plan is executed
against, and it belongs to neither side it hands to. **Both lanes pass through
it.** Drawing it inside `relational/` would be a lie about the fence: the
engine imports nothing from the package, while this module reads the schema.

**Data enters below the seam through one door.** `sources.tidy_sources` reads
every shape a caller may pass into tidy polars frames: a frame of any library,
a dict, a sequence, a bare number, a parquet path. **Both lanes enter by it.**
The relational engine executes its plan against those frames directly.
`linopy/loader.py` converts them to pandas and xarray at its own boundary, and
that conversion is all the linopy lane is. Polars is therefore the one
representation. pandas is a bridge at the edge of the extra that wants it.
The dependency set says the same: pandas is declared with `[linopy]` rather
than as a runtime dependency.

**One reader, because two disagreed.** When each lane read the caller's object
in its own library, the same instant had two spellings: a `datetime.date` out
of pandas and a `pl.Date` out of polars. That cost a reconciling guard at every
place the two met, and one of those guards was always missing. A conversion
cannot disagree with itself. Past `tidy_sources` nothing about the library a
caller reached for survives. The price is a copy the linopy lane makes of what
a pandas caller passed, which is the trade named in #1076.

The `method: convex` curvature guard sits below the seam for the neighbouring
reason: it needs values rather than a schema. It lives in `curves.py`, which the
door calls, so neither lane can enter without it. What matters for the waist is
the direction. Data goes no further **up** than here, so nothing above the seam
has ever seen a value. That is what makes `show it` and `check it` free.

The diagram shows the whole pipeline. math-spec reads a file into a `Spec` and
lowers it to the `Program`. `sources.py` turns your data into tidy frames. The
relational lane compiles the program against those frames, drains the model
through a sink and reads back a `Result`. The linopy lane loads the same frames
and evaluates the same program into a `linopy.Model`.

**The lanes are peers in what they take, not in what they hand back.** Both
accept the same file, attach the same tables and refuse the same constructs.
There the symmetry ends. `relational/` runs to an answer: it assembles the
model frames, hands them to a sink and reads the solution back as a `Result`.
`linopy/` stops at the object. Its whole surface is `build` and `expression`,
so the `linopy.Model` is yours, and linopy solves it and reads it back. That is
not a gap waiting to be closed. A caller who asks for a `linopy.Model` is
asking for linopy's own API on the far side of it, and a second `Result` there
would be a wrapper nobody wanted.

Eight modules sit outside a fence, and each is legitimately **both** halves.
They are the one drawn above; `curves.py`, the one guard that needs numbers;
`api.py`, which runs the lot; `strategy.py`, which drives it a slice at a time;
`lanes.py`, the facts the runner and the linopy lane both read (what a spec and
its sources may arrive as, and what each lane can build); `frames.py`, the
table boundary; `parquet.py`, the layout a result and a sweep both write their
answers to disk in; and `errors.py`, the leaf every fence points at. That is a
category, not a leftovers bin. The size of a module does not buy it a place: a
module only a single lane reaches is that lane's, down to a 24-line
contextmanager (`linopy/_notes.py`). See
[What counts as language](#what-counts-as-language).

Eligibility is decided by **attempting the lowering**. `to_program` returns a
`Program` or raises `lps.LanguageError`, so eligibility cannot drift from what
the engine supports. Both lanes call it. `relational/` executes the plan it
returns, and `linopy/` discards the plan, having asked only for the verdict.
That is what makes "neither lane accepts a file the other refuses" mechanical
rather than maintained. Errors split model from run. Everything under
`LanguageError` is decidable without data, `DataError` is what a source failed
to supply, and both are `LpspecError` (`errors.py`). `LaneError` is the third
thing that can be wrong, and the one hard rule 3 does not forbid. **Accepting
is not building.** A model both lanes accept may still meet a wall inside one
of them, and the lane says so in its own words rather than passing an upstream
exception through. Expansion precedes validation in **both** lanes, because a
formulation emits declarations and those are language too. A stray dim in
generated math is the same error as a stray dim in a written one.

## One contract, many consumers

The AST is a **narrow waist**. Everything upstream emits it, everything
downstream reads it, and nothing else has to agree on anything. So the model
you write once is the same model that gets checked, solved, typeset and read
back.

```

The diagram shows one YAML file becoming the whole model, and three consumers
reading that model: show it, check it and run it. Only the run arrow takes
data.

**Only one arrow carries data, and it arrives after the model is already
judged.** That is the contract the waist is. A `Spec` is complete before a
source is attached: names typed, dims checked, degree decided. So `show it` and
`check it` are not cut-down versions of a build. They are the same model with
the data arrow missing. `check` is the build's own front half, run to
completion and stopped before attaching. That is why it is a CI verb, costs
seconds, and needs nothing but the file.

**Each box is a family, and [the table below](#the-python-surface) lists the
members of the families this package answers.** `show it` is answered upstream
now, and that is the same point from the other side: none of them is a
rewrite. Each reads the same AST the engine reads. So a renderer is a tree
walk, a check is a pass with no data attached, and a new output format is one
module in `relational/sinks/writers/`.

**The renderer is that claim cashed, and it is not here.**
`math_spec.typesetting` typesets any model the lanes can build, in one walk of
the resolved AST. It holds no opinion the lanes do not already hold: a
`piecewise:` block prints as the λ-formulation it expands to, not as the sugar
it was written as. It lives in the same package as the language, and this
package does not depend on it. That is the strongest form the "a new consumer
is free" claim can take.

That is also the honest test of the waist: a consumer that reads the AST and
nothing else needs no part of this repository to run. What is here is what
genuinely touches data or a plan. Two properties carry the rest. **Data enters
at exactly one place**, which is why `check` needs no data. And the waist is
**closed**, which is what
[the ceiling](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/ceiling/)
protects: a new consumer is free, a new primitive is taxed. What is planned,
and why, is [the roadmap](roadmap.md).

### The Python surface

**Twenty-one names, and the count is the feature.** The model is the YAML
file, and Python is how you *run* it. So the whole surface is the diagram above
written out, with nothing that constructs math and nothing that reaches the
plan. Names are `lpspec.` unless shown otherwise, and what each one *does* is
[the Python API](../reference/api.md). **Data?** is the column that matters: a
verb that says *no* needs nothing but the file, which is what makes it a CI
verb. *Italic rows are the ones the shape makes cheap and nobody has built.*

**Loading a file and rendering one are not on this list.** `to_spec`,
`SymbolTable`, the three `to_…` renderers and the shell front that runs them
are `math_spec.`'s, counted in its own `__all__`. A caller that wants them
imports that package rather than a re-export here: one name, one home. What
this package exports is what it does, which is attach, build, solve and read
back.

**The errors are the exception, and they are the only one.** A name is
re-exported here when a caller meets it *without choosing to*. A
`LanguageError` arrives unbidden out of `lps.solve`, and no call reaches it.
The language's own nouns are not like that. `check` hands back a `Program` and
every verb accepts a `Spec`, but obtaining either means calling `math_spec`, so
a caller annotating one is already in the package that owns it. Re-exporting
them would be a second home for a name, which is the rule above.

**Nothing here reads a `Spec`.** Binding, the guards and both lanes take the
`Program`. A `Spec` reaching a verb is passed straight to
`math_spec.to_program` and never looked at. The model *as written*, which
means editing it, dumping it and typesetting it, is `math_spec`'s side of the
line.

**What a verb hands back is part of that verb's signature.** That is why
`Model`, `Result` and `Runs` are named here and not only reached off a call. A
caller that *wraps* this package, say a framework whose own function returns a
solve, writes the type down. A type it cannot import is a type it cannot
write. The same argument runs the errors one step further than the language
half. `NoSolutionError` is what every reader on a `Result` raises, and
`LpspecWarning` is what `check` emits, so a sweep that records an infeasible
scenario rather than dying on it needs both by name. None of the five
constructs math or reaches the plan. Each is what a verb already handed over,
which is the line the count is drawn on.

| | you want to | the call | data? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **check it** | will this build, is the math sayable, do the dims line up | `check` — parse → expand → validate → lower, one pass, every answer | no |
| | *will that solver take it* | | |
| **run it** | stream it straight into a solver | `solve`, or `build` → `Model` to drive several sinks off one build | **yes** |
| | re-solve one built model with new numbers | `model.update(...)` — the label contract, spent | **yes** |
| | how big is it, how is it scaled, what did the build and its solves do, and where did the time go | `model.diagnostics()` → `columns` · `rows` · `nonzeros` · `sink_columns` · `sink_rows` · `omissions` · `coefficient_range` · `bound_range` · `rhs_range` · `objective_range` · `solves` · `loads` · `timings`, all advisory | **yes** |
| | write an LP or MPS file for anything else | `write` | **yes** |
| | solve it once per scenario, window or period | `solve_over` over a `EachCoordinate` / `EachWindow` axis | **yes** |
| | build the same math as a `linopy.Model` | `lpspec.linopy.build` — `lps.build`'s own signature | **yes** |
| **carry it** | archive or send the file with its data, as one zip | `pack`, attaching through the same door as `build`; `unpack` extracts it and gives back what every verb takes | **yes** |
| **read it** | values, shadow prices, the objective | `result.objective` · `.primal` · `.dual`, plus the status pair | — |
| | the quantity the model named | `result.expression(name)` — lowered on demand at the read, never at build; `lpspec.linopy.expression` on the other lane | — |
| | bridge out to another library | `.to_pandas` · `.to_dataarray` · `.to_parquet` | — |
| | name it in your own signature | `Model` · `Result` · `Runs`, what `build`, `solve` and `solve_over` hand back; `Spec` re-exported for the model as written, and `math_spec.program.Program` for what `check` hands back | — |
| **catch it** | tell a bad model from bad data | `LpspecError` ⊃ `LanguageError` · `DataError` · `DimensionError` · `SchemaError` · `PiecewiseExpansionError` · `LaneError` | — |
| | record an infeasible run instead of dying on it | `NoSolutionError`, raised by every reader on a `Result` | — |
| | fail CI on advice, not just on errors | `LpspecWarning`, what `check` emits | no |

**The namespace is flat, and a namespace marks a lane rather than a topic.**
`lpspec.linopy` is the only one, and it earns it by being a different lane: its
own dependencies, its own oracle, its own surface of `build` and `expression`
with its own test. `strategy.py` is not a lane, so `solve_over` and its axes
sit at the top level beside `solve`.

That is a rule with teeth rather than a taste. The surface test exempts
submodules (`not inspect.ismodule`), so moving names under `lpspec.something`
moves them out from under the list a reviewer reads. **Grouping trades an
enforced surface for a tidier one**, which is the opposite of what the count
is for.

**A return type is not a name.** `build` returns a `Model`, `solve` a `Result`
and `solve_over` a `Runs`, and none is exported. You reach them by calling, and
import them from their module only to write an annotation. What the objects
themselves carry (`Result` alone has twelve readers) is documented in
[the Python API](../reference/api.md) rather than counted here. That is why
capability grows much faster than this table does.

One discipline keeps that from being a way to dodge the count: **a handle's
methods answer "what do I do with this", never "what is this"**. `solve`,
`write`, `close` and `update` pass. Anything that changed a declaration would
be a language feature wearing a method, and hard rule 5 refuses it wherever it
is spelled. It is also why these are named for what they *are* rather than for
what built them: a second engine must not change a top-level verb's return
type.

**What the data arrow carries** is [the data contract](../reference/data.md)
and is not restated here. The one structural fact: **attaching is by name at
both levels**. The mapping is keyed by declared parameter, and inside each
table the columns are named for that parameter's declared dims. The single
positional fallback (an *unnamed* pandas index) is narrow on purpose. Renaming
a named level would transpose the data silently whenever two dims share a label
space.

`tests/test_architecture.py` pins all of it: `__all__` must match the table,
**and** no public non-module attribute may exist outside it. Both directions,
because either alone rots. The first catches a name documented and never
exported. The second catches a helper that leaked into the namespace by being
imported at the top of `__init__.py`. That check found one the day it was
written.

There is deliberately no Python API for *constructing* a model, no way to hand
in a plan, and no registry to populate. That is hard rule 5 below. It is what
makes a `.yaml` file the thing you review, diff and cite, rather than the
serialisation of a Python object you would have to run to understand.

## Hard rules

*Enforced, not aspirational: `tests/test_architecture.py` encodes these as
static checks, and CI's bare-install job proves the dependency claims.*

**These rules constrain the language.** What a construct may say, which layer
may know what, and what a file means on its own: each survives any engine, and
each decides what can enter the language reference. How much a build *costs*
is a property of the engine, measured in [the benchmarks](benchmarks.md), and
deliberately not a rule. A cost phrased as a rule makes one implementation's
choice load-bearing in the language's rulebook.

0. **The layers are ordered, and imports prove it.** Every module imports only
   downward, at module level, with **no exception at all**.
   `DELIBERATE_LAZY_IMPORTS` in `tests/test_architecture.py` is empty, and an
   undeclared in-function import fails the build. A lazy import here is only
   ever a leftover: a cycle to remove, not to defer.
1. **Core AST is the whole language, and the language is upstream.** Both lanes
   consume only core AST. Macros and `piecewise:` are expanded away before
   dispatch. So is a named expression, unless it states `cases:`. That one
   arrives as a node of its own, because a mask in a value position is not
   something a substitution can carry. The plan, the query and the xarray are
   private to their lane. The AST crossing that seam is **fully resolved**, with
   names typed `Variable`/`Parameter`/`Dimension`, so a lane cannot hold its
   own opinion about what a name refers to. The waist is closed from the front
   by construction rather than by a test. What a model *means* cannot depend on
   what is done with it, because the package that decides the meaning does not
   depend on this one and cannot import it. That is a line in `pyproject.toml`
   rather than an allowlist a test in this repository could hold. **Our half of
   it is still checked**: every `math_spec` import under `src/lpspec` names the
   package and never a module inside it
   (`test_the_language_is_imported_as_one_package`). So what this repository
   depends on is the one `__all__` math-spec pins, rather than the union of
   whatever its submodules happen to expose. A submodule path would be a
   contract nobody agreed to: it can carry a private name, and it cannot be
   counted.
2. **The engine knows nothing about linopy, xarray or YAML.** `relational/`
   goes plan → engine → a solver sink → solver, with linopy's semantics as a
   spec to match rather than code to share. It never sees the schema, the AST,
   or the linopy builder. **The engine is a directory, not a convention.**
   `engines/polars/` is one implementation. Everything above it is what any
   implementation answers to: `sinks/`, `status.py`, and the plan vocabulary
   itself, which is `math_spec.program`'s. An engine package is named for its
   engine; nothing *inside* one is. The rule is enforced *more* strictly than
   stated. The engine imports nothing from the package at all, bar one declared
   leaf (`errors.py`, in `ENGINE_MAY_IMPORT`), because a near-zero import
   surface is what keeps the subpackage extractable. Widening that list is a
   decision, not an accident. **`errors.py` is a leaf by name and not by
   cost.** It re-exports the language's half of the hierarchy, so importing it
   loads the language. That is the price of the root class living upstream of
   everything that extends it. What the engine still raises through it is
   `DataError` and `LaneError`: a verdict about the *data*, or about this
   lane's reach. A verdict about what the file may **say** is the language's,
   made upstream on the spec before a program exists at all. What is left here
   asserts rather than refuses.
3. **One language, two lanes, and they are not fast and slow versions of each
   other.** Both build the models a file declares. The relational lane
   attaches and solves relationally, and the linopy lane constructs a
   `linopy.Model` the caller owns. **Both accept exactly the same language**,
   and that is structural rather than careful. The linopy lane runs the same
   `to_program` gate, so a construct the relational lane refuses is refused
   there in the same sentence. No operator registry exists that could create a
   divergence. That equality is what makes the differential tests an
   oracle rather than a comparison of dialects. A construct outside the
   language is a load error naming the construct and its rewrite, never a
   redirection to the other lane.

   **Accepting is not building, and one construct now separates them.** A lane
   may accept what it cannot construct. `linopy.Model.add_constraints` refuses
   a `QuadraticExpression`, so a quadratic *constraint* has no linopy lane.
   That is declared (`capabilities.LINOPY_LANE`), answerable before any build
   (`check(spec, sink='linopy')`) and refused in the language's own words. It
   is the axis
   [the ceiling](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/ceiling/#capability-is-not-the-ceiling)
   draws for sinks, one level up. **What it costs is the oracle.** A construct
   one lane builds is checked by one lane. The differential test is replaced
   by weaker ones that no shared misreading fails: two independent encodings
   reaching one optimum, and a residual at the returned primal. Every name
   added to that gap is a construct fewer eyes have seen.
4. **Backend-visible YAML files are self-contained.** No Python-side state
   (registries, session objects) may change what a file means.
5. **The public interface is a declared model, not a Python API.** YAML is what
   we ship and document. The contract underneath is the language's two states,
   a `Spec` and the `Program` it lowers to, and whether that seam is ever
   blessed is open ([#381](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/issues/381)). The
   Python surface is the runner (`api.py`) and the driver over it
   (`strategy.py`); the plan is internal. The whole of it is
   [twenty-one names](#the-python-surface), pinned by a test. So the surface
   grows through a list a reviewer reads, like every other fence here.

## The plan, node for node

**The plan is the vocabulary both lanes speak.** Each node has exactly one
meaning per lane, and this table is the whole of that mapping: what the file
writes, what the relational lane's query does with it, and which linopy call
the linopy lane makes. `tests/test_docs_site.py` holds it to
`math_spec.program.Expression`'s own subclasses. A node with no row here is a
node whose two readings nobody wrote down.

**The plan decides what is sayable; the engine only builds.** Every refusal
about the shape of a file is the language's, made upstream when the spec is
validated and never re-decided on this side of the pin. That covers a
reduction over a dimension its operand does not span, a mask wider than what it
masks, a bound reaching past its variable, and a degree no position takes.
Where the engine used to re-decide those after compiling, in fragment
vocabulary, it now asserts. Reaching one is a program that was never a valid
spec, not a file that said something wrong. The two verdicts it still *raises*
are its own: `DataError` about the data, and the `LaneError` for the one
construct the language accepts and this lane cannot build (#1137).

**Fan-in** is the column the lanes *act* on rather than merely document. It
says how an output row's slots relate to the input's. The language answers it
for every node, because `math_spec.program.fan_in` is total. So a lane asks,
rather than keeping its own list of which kinds reshape anything. Anything but
one-to-one mixes several input slots into one output row, so absence has to be
pushed into the operand before the rewrite consumes it. `Window` missing from
the list that used to hold this is how the lanes came to disagree about a
constant at a masked slot
([#1142](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/issues/1142)).

| plan node | the file writes | fan-in | the relational query | the linopy call |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Constant` | a number | one-to-one | a one-row const fragment | the number itself |
| `Parameter` | a declared name | one-to-one | its table as `(dims…, cval)` | its array, uncovered slots at zero |
| `Variable` | a declared name | one-to-one | `(dims…, var_label, coeff=1)`, plus where it exists; at a read, its primal as a const fragment with the same presence, a zero at every absent slot under `absence: zero` | the variable, carrying its declared `absence:`; at a read, its `.solution`, filled with zero under `absence: zero` |
| `Dual` | `dual(c)` | one-to-one | at a read only: the constraint's rows beside its share of the dual vector, a const fragment present exactly where a row stands | at a read only: linopy's `.dual` on the constraint |
| `Negate` | `-x` | one-to-one | the value column negated | `-` |
| `Add` | `x + y`, `x - y` | one-to-one | the two fragment lists concatenated | `+` |
| `Multiply` | `x * y` | one-to-one | a join on the shared dims; two variable factors pair into a quadratic fragment | `*` |
| `Divide` | `x / p` | one-to-one | a **left** join, so a divisor with no value leaves a null to report | `/` |
| `Power` | `p ** q` | one-to-one | an inner join and `pow` | `**` |
| `Sum` | `sum(x)`, `sum(x, over=d)` | many-to-one | the summed dims projected away — no aggregate | `.sum(dim)`, one dim at a time |
| `GroupSum` | `sum(x, by=lk)` | many-to-one | one inner join with the lookup's table, the grouped dim traded for its targets | `.groupby(targets).sum()`, reindexed onto the declared labels |
| `At` | `at(x, by=lk)` | one-to-one | the same table joined the other way, fanning out | a vectorised `.sel()` |
| `Translate` | `shift(x, over=d, offset=n)` | one-to-one | a remap through the dimension's `ord`, modulo its size under `wrap` | `.shift()`; `.roll()` under `wrap`; a `.sel()` gather where the offset differs per entity |
| `Window` | `sum_back(x, over=d, within=w)` | one-to-many | a row lands at every position whose window reaches it — no aggregate | the window's lags merged in one step |
| `Cases` | a named expression's `cases:` block | one-to-one | each region's value cut to its own mask and the fragment lists concatenated | each region's value filled with zero outside its mask, and the regions added |

A `Cases` is the one node carrying a **mask in a value position**, and the one
whose several values are alternatives rather than slots summed together. The
language proves the regions disjoint and total before any data attaches, so an
output row reads exactly one of them and neither lane ranks them. What each
lane must not do is let a region speak outside itself. A region's data is owed
only where the region applies. A region empty at a coordinate it does not
claim must leave the row that the other regions do cover.

**A read is the one walk where every leaf is a number.** A named expression is
evaluated after the solve, never built. The relational lane compiles a variable
to its primal and `dual(c)` to the constraint's row duals, as const fragments.
The linopy lane reads `.solution` and `.dual` and does xarray arithmetic. That
is why the language holds an entry the math never reads to no degree, and
neither lane needs one. A product of two variables, a variable under a power
and a division by one are arithmetic over values. It is also why `Dual` is the
one node a build refuses on sight. The language keeps it out of the math, and
only a read can answer it. A solve that left no duals refuses the read with the
sentence `result.dual` gives, and every other entry still reads.

**Neither reduction aggregates**, which is the theme the table repeats. A `Sum`
drops columns, a `GroupSum` swaps them and a `Window` replicates rows. Every
duplicate collapses once, in the terminal `SUM(coeff) GROUP BY row, col` at
assembly. The per-construct detail lives where it is acted on: the polars
column conventions in `compiler.py` and `fragments.py`, and the linopy calls
construct by construct in [linopy.md](linopy.md).

## The relational lane

**The spine is one module per box above.** `attaching.py` takes the tidy frames
`sources.py` handed over the seam and freezes them into what every query is
written against. `compiler.py` turns plan nodes into lazy frames and reads
nothing. `assembly.py` fills the model frames. `sinks/` drains them.
`engine.py` runs that lifecycle and holds the solver between solves. Three more
sit beside the engine rather than inside it, because each answers a question
the engine merely *uses*. `labels.py` decides which coordinate gets which
solver index. `readback.py` spells a row or a solve back out in the model's own
names. `result.py` is what a caller reads a solve back through. The remaining
four are not on the spine, and the diagram does not draw them. `fragments.py`
is the vocabulary a compiled expression is *in* (the one the spine itself
speaks is upstream). `predicates.py` is the vocabulary a `where:` is in.
`reindex.py` is the two operators that walk a dimension's own order.
`status.py` is the boundary a solver's verdict comes back over. The other
boundary, a caller's table on the way in, is `frames.py`. It is top level
rather than in this lane, because all three consumers read it. The map below
is the full list.

That split is what makes the ceiling's admissibility test something you can
*perform* rather than reason about. Build a `PolarsCompiler`, hand it a node,
read `.explain()`. `tests/test_compiler.py` does exactly that over empty
frames, since a schema is all it takes to compile a query. It is also why a new
sink is a module in one of two families rather than another method on the
engine.

**What attaching produces is a value.** `AttachedSources` is frozen:
parameters, dimensions, their cardinalities, and which parameters are boolean.
It is frozen because a query is written against data that has stopped
changing. The variable frames are passed *beside* it and stay mutable. A
variable frame appears as its declaration is built, and a constraint compiled
afterwards has to see it. That is the one live registry in the lane. Keeping
it out of the carrier is what makes it visible in a signature rather than only
in a docstring.

**What a build produces is a value too, for the same reason.** `BuiltModel` is
frozen: the model frames, the label frames, the per-declaration blocks and the
compiler that made them. A build is finished when it exists. What fills during
assembly lives on `_Assembly`, which is discarded once it has frozen. So the
engine holds one field where it used to hold a frame each. "Has this engine
got a model" is one question rather than seven, `close()` is one assignment,
and a build that raises leaves no model rather than half of one. What survives
that release is `_Measured`, the counts `diagnostics()` reports. They are
measurements about the build rather than parts of it.

**Tables are tidy.** Parameters are `(dims…, value)`. A variable frame is
`(dims…, var_label)`, one row per *existing* variable. A linear expression is
`(frame dims…, var_label, coeff)` plus a constant part. Constraint rows are
`(row, sense, rhs)`. The coefficient matrix is COO `(row, col, coeff)` while
declarations build, and lands as CSR at assembly: `(col, coeff)` in row-major
order plus a `row_starts` offset array. Those are the same three arrays a
solver takes, at 12 bytes per entry. Masks are **row absence**: no NaN
sentinels, no `-1` labels. Broadcasting is a join. `sum` drops coordinate
columns, and `sum(by=)` joins the dim table and projects a declared lookup in
place of the grouped dim. Neither aggregates. Both rewrite a fragment's dim
tuple, and the duplicates collapse at assembly as
[above](#the-plan-node-for-node).

**The label contract is the one place order is load-bearing.** Everything else
in the lane is order-free, which is what lets the query planner rearrange it.

- **Labels are dense `0..n-1` by construction**, so `var_label` **is** the
  solver column index and `row` the solver row index, with no remapping. That
  is what `update` spends. New bounds, costs and right-hand sides go onto a
  loaded solver by position, and appending rows moves no column and renumbers
  no existing row. Structural editing stays out of scope. An update that *does*
  move a label is a rebuild, and the answer is the same either way.
- **Labels are row-major over the masked coordinate product**, sorted on the
  dimensions' declared ordinals. That is a contract, not a side effect: it is
  what makes a build reproducible run to run.
- **Variables and constraint rows are the same operation over different
  frames**, and it is written once (`labels.frame`): number the surviving
  coordinates by their row-major position in the declared product. A mask that
  cannot see the leading dims leaves the survivors a *rectangle*, so only the
  masked suffix is materialised. That is a guarded shortcut inside that one
  function, and it must reach the integers the general path would have. It is
  why labelling is a module with stated inputs rather than a method among
  twenty: nothing else about a build can move an index.
- **The same order comes back.** `primal` / `dual` / `to_parquet` read the
  label frame, which was numbered in that order, and the LP sink writes it.

**The plan is affine-by-design.** No node introduces variables or constraints
as a side effect of an expression; formulations are model *transformations*.
Variable *types* are not formulations. Binary and integer are a `vtype`
column, LP `binary`/`general` sections and HiGHS integrality, which keeps basic
MILP inside the relational lane. **`sos:` is the same shape.** It is a
`SosDeclaration` naming columns the variable already made, one more stream out
of the engine, and no expression node. That is why a set can be carried whole
to a sink that has the concept. Reimplementing linopy's reformulation passes
inside the plan is explicitly rejected: that duplicates the library this
package consumes. Where one is unavoidable, for a sink with no SOS at all, it
happens at the *sink* boundary, on the built tables, and never in the plan.

**A frame is the boundary in both directions.** `frames.py` recognises a
caller's table through the Arrow PyCapsule protocol without importing any
dataframe library. `Result.primal` hands back a `polars.DataFrame`, which
exports the same protocol. That symmetry is what keeps pandas and pyarrow off
the dependency list. They are bridges *out* (`to_pandas`, `to_dataarray`),
shipped with the `[linopy]` extra, not shapes the engine holds. The
bare-install CI job runs the suite with neither present.

**Sinks are capped, explicitly.** Four streams and no more: `cols` (bounds,
objective coefficients, integrality), `rows`, `A` in CSR, and `sos`, the
special-ordered sets as `(set, type, col, weight, big_m)`. The upgrade path
from here is `genconstr`, plus a semi-continuous threshold on `cols`.

**The fourth stream is the one that lands unevenly**, because its destination
differs per sink (see
[Capability is not the ceiling](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/ceiling/#capability-is-not-the-ceiling)).
So a solver **declares** how it satisfies one, `native` or `reformulated`, and
the *family* acts on the answer (`solvers.ingestible`). A sink that cannot take
a set is handed the same feasible region as binaries and linking rows
(`sinks/sos.py`, whose README carries the per-sink table). Declared rather than
discovered at the hand-off is what
[Track 3](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/issues/472) asked for, and this is
its first two entries.

What the rewrite adds goes **after** the model, which is the label contract
spent rather than bent. An appended column moves none of the model's own, and
an appended row renumbers none of its rows. So a solve reads its answer back by
the same slice either way.

**A sink is one of two things, and the directory says which.** A **solver**
runs the tables and returns an answer, chosen by **name** at the call
(`solver_name='gurobi'`). A **writer** renders them to a file, chosen by the
output's **suffix**. A file's format is a property of the file, while which
solver runs is a property of nothing but the call. Both sets are closed dict
literals (`SOLVERS`, `WRITERS`): no YAML key names a solver, and nothing
installed may change what either resolves to.

The split is a directory rather than a convention, for the reason `engines/`
is: **how many solvers there are will change, and what a solver has to answer
will not.** A new one is a module named for it and a line in `SOLVERS`, and
nothing above it changes. Members share the projection of `cols` and `obj`
onto the solver's column index. That projection lives on `Tables`, so two
solvers cannot drift into loading different models. They never share hand-off
code, for two reasons. The currencies differ: HiGHS and Xpress take the three
CSR arrays, gurobipy a matrix object. And an optional package must stay off
the import path of a caller who does not use it.

### Quadratic objectives at the sink

Neither direct API has a per-coefficient counterpart to `changeCoeff`:
`passHessian` and `setMObjective` take the quadratic part whole. Under the
aligned-only scope (`variable × variable` at the same coordinates) `Q` is
**diagonal**. So it costs 16 bytes per quadratic column: 0.16 GB at 10⁷
columns, 1.60 GB at 10⁸, against a direct-sink peak already dominated by the
solver's own model. HiGHS accepts `dim_ < num_col` (verified), so ordering the
quadratic variables first bounds the Hessian to that block.

**The diagonal argument dies as soon as the product is not aligned**, and the
language does not restrict it to aligned. `x[i] * y[i, j]` broadcasts, and
`x[i] * y[j] * a[i, j]` joins through a table. The replacement bound is one
entry per pair the expression states, the `nnz` of whatever couples the
factors, which is still a declared-shape quantity. What is not is the cross
join of two reductions, and that is the shape the language refuses
(`math_spec.degree`).

**Whole is not the same as reloading.** A second `passHessian` lands on the
model already loaded, replacing `Q` and leaving the LP standing. So a moved
quadratic *coefficient* is pushed like a cost, and only the sparsity *pattern*
is structure.

## Module map

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `math_spec` (a dependency) | the whole language: the file is read, expanded, resolved, judged and lowered there, and what crosses into this repository is its two public states — a `Spec`, what the file says, and the `Program` it lowers to — [its own reference](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/language/) |
| `api.py` | the runner: `check` / `build` / `solve` / `write`, and `pack` / `unpack` carrying a model with its data as one zip; linopy-free |
| `lanes.py` | above both lanes: `Buildable` and `Source`, what every verb takes as the spec and under each name of its sources, `Label`, what a dimension's labels and a sweep's keys are, and `LANES`, what each lane can build, read by `check` without the extra and by the eager lane when it refuses |
| `sources.py` | the one door: a caller's data (parquet paths, in-memory tables, plain-Python shapes) read into tidy frames and checked against the declarations — one row per coordinate, labels that exist, values present and of the declared type |
| `curves.py` | the one guard that needs numbers rather than a schema: is a `piecewise:` curve supplied everywhere it is built, monotone, and of the curvature its method is exact for |
| `frames.py` | the boundary — caller tables in, via the Arrow PyCapsule protocol; read by the front door, the driver and the linopy lane |
| `errors.py` | the run half, and the whole re-exported — what a caller catches off `lps.`; a wording lives here only where two modules raise it |
| `strategy.py` | the driver above the runner: one plan per slice, folded — scenarios, rolling horizon, myopic pathways |
| `relational/engines/polars/compiler.py` | plan → lazy frames; pure, reads nothing |
| `relational/engines/polars/reindex.py` | `shift` and `sum_back`: moving a fragment's rows along one dimension's own order, and what happens at the edge |
| `relational/engines/polars/predicates.py` | a `where:` mask as a boolean query over the coordinate product; the plan's predicate nodes, and nothing else |
| `relational/engines/polars/fragments.py` | what an expression compiles *to*: the additive pieces and the arithmetic over them; holds no state and reads no data |
| `relational/status.py` | solve outcome on two axes; linopy's vocabulary, copied not imported |
| `relational/engines/polars/labels.py` | which coordinate gets which solver index; one rule, one guarded shortcut that must agree with it |
| `relational/engines/polars/attaching.py` | the door's frames → `AttachedSources`, the frozen, `Enum`-encoded frames every query is written against |
| `relational/engines/polars/assembly.py` | one build: every declaration into rows of the model frames, quadratic constraints last |
| `relational/engines/polars/readback.py` | a built row, a solve's frames and a named expression, spelled back out in the model's own labels |
| `relational/engines/polars/engine.py` | the lifecycle: build, hand to a sink, read back, the counters and clocks `diagnostics()` reports |
| `relational/result.py` | what a solve returned: status, objective, and the label joins that read values back |
| `relational/parquet.py` | answers on disk: the `<kind>/<name>` layout a result and a sweep both write, and the writer that lands a file whole |
| `relational/sinks/tables.py` | what every sink reads and no more — the five frames plus the batching scalars, and their projection onto the solver's column index; what an engine produces |
| `relational/sinks/capabilities.py` | what a sink can ingest — hard rule 3's *accepts ≠ builds* axis; `lanes.py` declares each **lane** against the same vocabulary |
| `relational/sinks/sos.py` | the one stream a sink may not be able to ingest, written as two it can: sets → binaries and linking rows |
| `relational/sinks/` | how a built model leaves, in two families: `solvers/` (one module per solver, chosen by name) and `writers/` (one per format, chosen by suffix) — [README](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/blob/main/src/lpspec/relational/sinks/README.md) |
| `linopy/__init__.py` | the lane's two verbs: `build` constructing a `linopy.Model`, and `expression` reading a named quantity off a solved one |
| `linopy/loader.py` | the crossing into pandas and xarray: `tidy_sources`' frames as master coords and an `xr.Dataset` |
| `linopy/coverage.py` | the two positions an absent row has no reading for: a divisor and a constant side |
| `linopy/absence.py` | the four positions an absent value is spelled differently in — absence is positional in this lane |
| `linopy/builder.py` | eager backend: core AST → `linopy.Model` |
| `linopy/operators.py` | the eager evaluation of every built-in, on xarray and linopy |
| `linopy/where.py` | a resolved `where:` as a boolean array, and the shape linopy's `mask=` takes |
| `linopy/_notes.py` | attach context to an exception on the way out; no package imports, no opinions |

**Two subpackages, and the directory *is* the rule in both cases.** Everything
under `relational/` is the relational lane, and it imports nothing else from
the package. A second boundary sits inside it: `engines/` holds
implementations, and the rest of `relational/` is what they implement.
Everything under `linopy/` is the linopy lane, and it is the only code allowed
to import linopy or xarray. `tests/test_architecture.py` reads membership off
the path in both cases.

**A fence whose allowlist is empty is a package waiting to happen.** Two fences
here were once that, and they are the same claim twice. `language/` was fenced
to import nothing from this package, with an allowlist kept empty so the
directory could be lifted out without an edit. `typeset/` was fenced to read
the AST and nothing else. Both were lifted out. What the two fences were
protecting is now protected by them being somewhere else.

What remains points one way. `relational/`'s fence points outward at one
declared leaf, `errors.py`. The language's fence points nowhere at all, because
the language is not here. `errors.py` is the seam that survived in the other
direction. The root class lives upstream, so importing this package's errors
imports the language, and the run half extends the model half rather than
paralleling it.

### What counts as language

The rule is
[its own page](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/what-counts-as-language/),
because it decides what may live here rather than how this package is
arranged:

> **A rule is language iff two consumers answering it separately would be a
> bug.**

Every "one implementation each" rule in this file is that test applied, and
the implementations are now upstream. Names resolve once
(`math_spec.resolution`). The operator set is closed (`math_spec.operators`),
and lowering turns it into the closed plan-node set both lanes dispatch on.
That set is the axis a test here holds the lanes to, and neither lane keeps a
table of operator names. An operator's dim rule lives only in
`math_spec.dimensions`, and lowering **asks** for the verdict rather than
deciding again. Degree lives only in `math_spec.degree`. `math_spec.piecewise`
is upstream by the same test: a formulation emits declarations, and
declarations are language. The rule decided where the cut fell. Everything it
called language went, and everything it did not stayed.

The test also says what cannot follow the rest upstream. `curves.py` answers a
question two consumers answering separately *would* be a bug: is this curve
monotone, and is its curvature the one the declared method is exact for. So by
the rule it is language. It is here because the answer needs numbers, and the
language has never seen one. The half that does not need them is upstream: a
block's `assumptions` name each condition, `assumption_message` words the
refusal, and the caller holding the values does the checking. A rule is only
ours when data is what decides it.

The corollary is what the top level is *for*. A module stays flat when it is
legitimately **both** halves: `sources.py` attaches data to a validated schema,
`curves.py` judges the numbers it attached, `api.py` runs the lot. That is a
real category and a small one. A flat module should be arguable.

### Naming across the layers

The same construct passes through three layers, and each names it in full.
Nothing is abbreviated, so a name never has to be decoded. The **layer is the
suffix**, which is what keeps the three vocabularies from colliding:

| Layer | Suffix | Example |
|---|---|---|
| YAML block (`math_spec.model`) | `Block` | `VariableBlock`, `PiecewiseBlock` |
| Core AST (`math_spec.*_parser`) | `Node` | `VariableNode`, `DimensionComparisonNode` |
| Program (`math_spec.program`) | none / `Declaration` | `Variable`, `VariableDeclaration` |

All three rows are another package's now, which is exactly why the table
stays. Every name a lane dispatches on is spelled against a vocabulary this
repository does not control, and a rename upstream that collides here is a
thing to notice.

Two rules follow from that table, and a PR that adds a construct keeps them:

- **A node names the coordinate map, not a surface spelling.** The translation
  node is `Translate`, and it stayed that way when the surface collapsed to a
  single `shift(…, edge=)`. The node is named for what it does to coordinates,
  so which keyword the language happens to expose does not reach it.
- **Nothing is abbreviated.** `Cmp` became `ParameterComparison`, and `vtype`
  became `variable_type`. The one place abbreviation survives is frame column
  names inside the engine, which are not Python identifiers.

### Names shared with linopy

For anything this package shares with linopy (solve statuses, result shapes,
solver metrics, duals) adopt **linopy's primitive**: its spelling, its field
names, its decomposition. `status` / `termination_condition` are two axes and
`is_ok` is the rollup, because that is linopy's model. Our audience arrives
from linopy and PyPSA, and a second vocabulary for one fact is a tax on all of
them. It also keeps the oracle honest, since the lanes can then be compared
exactly.

**Copy it; do not import it.** The engine may not import linopy (rule 2), so
the tables live here. A test imports linopy to assert the copy still matches
(`tests/test_solve_status.py`), because a copy nobody checks is a copy that
rots.

This applies to vocabulary we *share*. Where the design genuinely differs it
stays ours. There is no `Solution` of dense arrays to hold, because values are
read back by joining labels to coordinates.

## Extension checklists

**Add a macro or named expression:** edit YAML. Nothing else.

**Add a sink:** a module in `relational/sinks/solvers/` named for the solver,
or one in `writers/` keyed by suffix in `WRITERS`. A solver module defines
`solve_<name>` and `build_<name>`, takes one line in `SOLVERS`, and keeps its
dependency behind an extra and imported inside the function. Either way the
module declares what it can ingest, as a `Capabilities` descriptor beside the
code that knows, since a sink declaring nothing reads as taking nothing.
Nothing above it changes: no method on the engine, no branch in `api.py`, no
name on the Python surface. The
[README](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/blob/main/src/lpspec/relational/sinks/README.md)
is the full list, and `tests/test_architecture.py` checks the shape off the
path.

**Add a consumer of the AST** (a renderer, a checker, a report): a package of
its own, depending on `math-spec` and not on this one. It reads
`math_spec.to_spec` and stops there. If it needs the plan it is a lane, not a
consumer, and the ceiling doc is the conversation to have first. The renderer
is the worked example: it was a fenced directory here until the fence turned
out to be a package boundary.

**Add an operator:** two repositories, in this order. **In math-spec:** grammar
(usually free, since `f(x, k=v)` already parses) → signature in
`operators.BUILTINS` → its dim rule and its degree verdict → the plan node it
lowers to → the language reference. The signature holds the arity and which
arguments name dimensions. Resolution, validation and lowering all read it
from there, so the shape is declared once. Then **here**, against a released
tag: linopy implementation → compiler case → engine → differential test through
a solver *and* the LP writer, and this file if structural. The pin is what
sequences them. Nothing in this repository can lower an operator the pinned
language does not parse, so the upstream half lands and is tagged first.
[The nightly canary](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/blob/main/.github/workflows/canary.yml)
is what says the two halves have not drifted since.

Three things are deliberately *not* per-operator work, because they are one
implementation each. An operator's dim rule lives only in
`math_spec.dimensions`: both its dim *set* and its verdict on an operand that
lacks the dim being reduced along, which lowering asks for rather than deciding
again. Its degree verdict lives only in `math_spec.degree`, which both lanes
ask. The dense-label assignment that gives a coordinate its solver index lives
only in `relational/engines/polars/labels.py`, shared by variables and
constraint rows. What a consumer still owns is what is about *building*: the
fragment rewrite the relational compiler performs, and the linopy call the
linopy lane makes.
