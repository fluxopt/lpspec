# How the benchmarks were taken

This page is the method behind the numbers on the
[benchmark page](benchmarks-scaling.html), for anyone deciding how far to
trust a cell there. The results themselves are on that page: five libraries
over four models, with the numbers under each chart.

**Every published number is the median of a measurement's rounds, and every
band is the first to the third quartile of the same rounds.** Nine rounds is
the floor. The number is not the fastest round: that is a best-of-n, and n is
not equal, because the harness calibrates by duration. It is not the mean
either. One round in forty of a 20 ms measurement took 1.5 s here, which drags
a mean to 2.9x its median.

That choice cost us. Nine cells flipped against lpspec, all on the `gurobi`
sink (where a built model lands: a solver or a file writer,
[glossary](../reference/glossary.md#how-it-runs)). There our build alternates
between a fast and a slow state round after round, and no other library's
build does ([#1288](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/issues/1288)).

## How to reproduce it

```bash
uv run --locked bench/reproduce.py
```

`bench/reproduce.py.lock` freezes every version, git commits included. Two of
the five libraries install from git and one of those is a branch, so without
the lock "the versions that produced this number" is unrepeatable. `--locked`
refuses to start if the resolution has drifted.

Everything the tables are drawn from is in
[`bench/results`](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/blob/main/bench/results):
one file per sink and case, because each is measured in a process of its own.
Each file carries the machine, the versions, the commit and every round of
every measurement. A case the box could not finish leaves no file behind, so
the directory holds what ran and nothing else. `pixi run table` prints it as
one long CSV and commits nothing. The JSON is the archive because it keeps the
rounds. Re-taking rather than reproducing is `pixi run refresh`, which writes
the tables into their fences and the chart's data literal into its own.

## First model against every model after it

One model is built, then built again in the same process.

<!-- bench:marginal -->

### Marginal cost per model

Build only, repeated in one process. **first** is the first recorded round and **steady** the best of the rounds after it, so the pair is what a rolling horizon pays for its second window against its first. The harness warms up before it records, so neither column carries the one-time import cost: the median gap between them is +8.7 ms on lpspec and +1.5 ms on linopy and +5.7 ms on pyomo and +17.2 ms on gurobipy-loop and +29.4 ms on gurobipy-matrix.

**Read down a column, not across the row.** The build is not the same work in every library — one that defers materialising its coefficients to its writer spends almost nothing here and pays it at the seam — so these columns carry no ratios. The tables above measure to a common artifact and are where a comparison belongs.

## The same size, reached by widening

Entity counts x N, snapshots fixed: the same sizes as the ladder, in a
different shape.

<!-- bench:sweeps -->

### The width ladder

Entity counts x N with the snapshot count held fixed, through the `highs` sink. Each rung matches one of the size ladder rungs above variable for variable — `w10` is `s`, `w1000` is `l` — so the pair reads as one model at one size in two shapes.

| case | entities x | variables | wall: lpspec | wall: linopy | wall: pyomo | wall ÷ linopy | wall ÷ pyomo | peak: lpspec | peak: linopy | peak: pyomo | peak ÷ linopy | peak ÷ pyomo |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| storage | 1 | 10k | 0.04 s | 0.08 s | 0.31 s | 0.55x | 0.14x | 0.22 GB | 0.24 GB | 0.19 GB | 0.90x | 1.16x |

## Not measured yet

Listed so that a claim with no table under it is visible as one.

- **Solve time.** Every number stops at the hand-off. The simplex is the
  solver's work whoever filled the model.
- **The LP-file round trip.** The tables price writing a file, never reading
  one back.
- **Sizes past `l`.** `xl` and `2xl` exist in the harness and no run
  publishes them.
- **The width ladder past `w10`.** `w100` and `w1000` are left out of the
  published run rather than measured and dropped. `transport/w100` on linopy
  peaks at 14.26 GB, and a measurement holds the model twice, so the cell wants
  more machine than the box has. The budget cannot stop it either: it projects
  the next rung linearly off a `w10` cell that took under a gigabyte. What is
  lost is the runner rather than the rung
  ([#1416](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/issues/1416)). The last numbers
  taken there are in [#1285](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/pull/1285), on
  the machine that could hold them: lpspec 0.11 s and 0.59 GB against linopy
  53.53 s and 14.26 GB at `transport/w100`.
- **Anything about expressiveness.** Four models say nothing about a fifth.

## Method

Each measurement runs in a process of its own. Peak memory is `ru_maxrss`
rather than a tracker. Import is excluded from the timing and teardown is
included. A run refuses to start on a machine that is already working. The
rest is in
[`bench/README.md`](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/blob/main/bench/README.md):
every flag, every default switched off and what it costs.

**Peak carries an allocator cost that only the polars arms pay.** polars
ships its own jemalloc settings, so a peak measured through it holds pages
freed and not yet returned. An arm on the system allocator never enters
jemalloc at all. Our peak moves 12–27% with the decay clock on and off, where
linopy's does not move at three digits
([#896](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/issues/896)). It runs against us and
is left in.

**memray never times anything.** Its tracker slows an allocation-heavy
engine several-fold and overcounts reserved arenas. Peak RSS is the metric;
memray is for attribution.
