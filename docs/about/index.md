# About

This section explains why the package is shaped the way it is, what it costs,
where it came from and where it is going. Nothing here is needed to write or
run a model. That is [the guide](../guide.md), [the API](../reference/api.md)
and [the language](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/language/).

| | |
|---|---|
| [Architecture](architecture.md) | the thesis, the hard rules, the lane from YAML to solver, and the module map |
| [The ceiling](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/ceiling/) | what the language deliberately cannot say, and what that buys |
| [Decomposition](decomposition.md) | Benders as evidence: an algorithm the language does not contain, written as a loop over models it does |
| [Benchmarks](benchmarks.md) | measured build and solve cost against linopy, with the method and how to reproduce it |
| [Relationship to linopy](linopy.md) | not a runtime dependency, the differential oracle, and the second lane |
| [Prior art and credit](prior-art.md) | the work this is derived from, and how to cite it |
| [Roadmap](roadmap.md) | where it is going, and what it will not become |
| [Changelog](changelog.md) | every release |

How to contribute, with the test loop, the CI gates and how to add a solver or a port, is
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/blob/main/AGENTS.md) in the
repository.
