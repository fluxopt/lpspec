# PyPSA Store — one signed power, and no rating at all

The component every sector-coupled PyPSA model uses for hydrogen, heat and gas.

> **✔ Verified against pypsa 1.2.4 (its own linopy 0.9.0)** — objective **7005.5025000000005**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

[Storage units](pypsa_storage.md) ports the `StorageUnit`: a dispatch/store pair of
non-negative variables so the two efficiencies can differ, and a power rating of
its own. A `Store` is a different component, not a re-parametrisation of that
one:

| | `StorageUnit` | `Store` |
|---|---|---|
| power | two non-negative variables | **one signed** variable |
| efficiencies | store and dispatch, separately | **none** |
| power rating | `p_nom` | **none** — the level is the only limit |
| capacity built | `p_nom` (power) | `e_nom` (energy) |

The tank starts 20 MWh full, fills over the three quiet snapshots and drains
over the two busy ones, losing 5% of what it holds each step. Its capacity is a
decision: 75.1 MWh, the exact peak of its own trajectory.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

PyPSA's Store component: one signed power at the bus, no efficiencies and no power rating — only the energy level limits how fast it moves. The tank fills early and drains late, losing a share of what it holds every snapshot, and its energy capacity is built rather than given. Optimum 7005.5025000000005, from PyPSA itself.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathcal{T}$ | index $t$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $\mathcal{B}$ | index $b$ — `bus` with $\mathrm{gen\_bus}: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{B},\enspace \mathrm{store\_bus}: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{B}$ — network nodes |
| $\mathcal{G}$ | index $g$ — `generator` with $\mathrm{gen\_bus}: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{B}$ — generating units, each sitting on one bus |
| $\mathcal{S}$ | index $s$ — `store` with $\mathrm{store\_bus}: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{B}$ — energy stores, each sitting on one bus |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}$ | `p_nom` over $\mathcal{G}$ — installed capacity of a generator |
| $\mathrm{marginal\_cost}$ | `marginal_cost` over $\mathcal{G}$ — cost of one unit of output |
| $\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{nom,max}}$ | `e_nom_max` over $\mathcal{S}$ — most energy capacity that may be built at a store |
| $\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{capital,cost}}$ | `e_capital_cost` over $\mathcal{S}$ — cost of holding one unit of energy capacity over the horizon |
| $\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{initial}}$ | `e_initial` over $\mathcal{S}$ — energy in the store before the first snapshot |
| $\mathrm{standing\_loss}$ | `standing_loss` over $\mathcal{S}$ — share of the carried-over level lost between snapshots |
| $\mathrm{load}$ | `load` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{B}$ — demand at each bus in each snapshot |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $p$ | `p` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}$ — output of a generator in a snapshot |
| $\mathit{store\_p}$ | `store_p` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{S}$ — power a store puts onto its bus, negative when it takes power off — unbounded, because a Store has no rating of its own |
| $e$ | `e` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{S}$ — energy in the store at the end of a snapshot |
| $e^{\mathrm{nom}}$ | `e_nom` over $\mathcal{S}$ — energy capacity built at a store |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $p$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

$\mathrm{pos}(t)$ denotes where index $t$ sits along its dimension's own order — the order `shift` walks, not the order labels sort in — counted from $0$. The index itself stays the coordinate, so $t$ compares against labels and $\mathrm{pos}(t)$ against positions.

#### Objective

$$\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{marginal\_cost}_{g} + \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} e^{\mathrm{nom}}_{s} \cdot \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{capital,cost}}_{s}$$

#### Subject to

**`nodal_balance`**

$$\sum_{g \in \mathcal{G} \thinspace:\thinspace \mathrm{gen\_bus}(g) = b} p_{t,g} + \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S} \thinspace:\thinspace \mathrm{store\_bus}(s) = b} \mathit{store\_p}_{t,s} = \mathrm{load}_{t,b} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace b \in \mathcal{B}$$

**`within_capacity`**

$$e_{t,s} \le e^{\mathrm{nom}}_{s} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace s \in \mathcal{S}$$

**`energy_balance_initial`**

$$e_{t,s} = \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{initial}}_{s} - \mathit{store\_p}_{t,s} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace s \in \mathcal{S} \thinspace:\thinspace \mathrm{pos}(t) = 0$$

**`energy_balance`**

$$e_{t,s} = e_{t - 1,s} \cdot \left( 1 - \mathrm{standing\_loss}_{s} \right) - \mathit{store\_p}_{t,s} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace s \in \mathcal{S}$$

#### Variable domains

**`p`**

$$0 \le p_{t,g} \le \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`store_p`**

$$\mathit{store\_p}_{t,s} \in \mathbb{R} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace s \in \mathcal{S}$$

**`e`**

$$e_{t,s} \ge 0 \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace s \in \mathcal{S}$$

**`e_nom`**

$$0 \le e^{\mathrm{nom}}_{s} \le \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{nom,max}}_{s} \qquad \forall\thinspace s \in \mathcal{S}$$

**The standing loss is visible in the price vector, which is why it is recorded.**
The nodal prices run `68.79, 72.41, 76.23, 85.50, 90.00, 10.00` — each earlier
snapshot's price is the next one's divided by 0.95, because a unit stored now is
worth 0.95 of a unit later. A port that dropped the decay would still solve and
still look sensible; it would hold more energy than it should, buy less gas, and
report a lower cost. The dual vector catches it where a single objective figure
might not.

**The initial level is not decayed, and the instance can tell.** PyPSA's first
row is `e = e_initial - p`, so the 20 MWh in the tank before the horizon arrives
whole. Decay it and the same instance costs **7074.30** against **7005.50** — a
version with an empty tank reports 3116.36 either way, which is what this
model was doing.

**A store with no rating still cannot move arbitrary power**, because the level
it draws from is bounded and the level it charges into is too. That is why the
port declares `store_p` with no bounds at all — an upper bound written here
would be a limit PyPSA does not have.

## What it exercises

An energy recurrence over one signed variable, a capacity variable bounding a
time-indexed variable (`e <= e_nom`, two decisions rather than a decision and a
bound), and a `shift` across the horizon's opening boundary.
