# PyPSA committable and extendable — the one place a big-M is unavoidable

A minimum output that is a share of a capacity still being decided: two variables multiplied, and one constant to take them apart.

> **✔ Verified against pypsa 1.2.4 (its own linopy 0.9.0)** — objective **21700.0**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

[Unit commitment](pypsa_unit_commitment.md) holds capacity fixed, so
`p >= p_min_pu * p_nom * status` is a parameter against a variable and stays
degree 1. Make the capacity a decision and the same sentence is a product of two
of them — the one shape in PyPSA's committable machinery that cannot be written
down as it reads.

PyPSA's answer is three rows and a constant *M* (`constraints.py:304`):

| row | what it says |
|---|---|
| `p - p_min_pu * p_nom - M * status >= -M` | the floor, and slack by all of *M* while the unit is off |
| `p - M * status <= 0` | off means zero |
| `p - p_nom <= 0` | the capacity limit, committed or not |

*M* is not free. PyPSA takes `p_nom_max * p_max_pu` where a maximum is declared
and otherwise **infers a scale from the network** — which is what
`create_model(committable_big_m=...)` exists to override. This instance declares
`p_nom_max`, so *M* is 100 on both sides: the port passes that number as data.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

PyPSA's committable unit whose capacity is also being built: the minimum output is a share of a capacity that is itself a decision, so the product of the status and the capacity is linearised with a big-M the model declares rather than infers. One unit is both committed and built, one is only built. Optimum 21700.0, from PyPSA itself.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathcal{T}$ | index $t$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $\mathcal{G}$ | index $g$ — `generator` — generating units, some of which are committed rather than merely dispatched |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{min,pu}}$ | `p_min_pu` over $\mathcal{G}$ — share of its built capacity a committed unit must produce while on |
| $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom,max}}$ | `p_nom_max` over $\mathcal{G}$ — most capacity a generator may build |
| $\mathrm{big\_m}$ | `big_m` over $\mathcal{G}$ — a bound on the output of a committed unit, large enough never to bind on its own — the capacity ceiling times the availability, and present only for the units that are committed at all |
| $\mathrm{marginal\_cost}$ | `marginal_cost` over $\mathcal{G}$ — cost of one unit of output |
| $\mathrm{capital\_cost}$ | `capital_cost` over $\mathcal{G}$ — cost of holding one unit of capacity over the horizon |
| $\mathrm{load}$ | `load` over $\mathcal{T}$ — demand to be met |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $p$ | `p` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}$ — output of a generator in a snapshot |
| $p^{\mathrm{nom}}$ | `p_nom` over $\mathcal{G}$ — capacity built at a generator |
| $\mathit{status}$ | `status` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}$ — is this unit committed in this snapshot? Declared only for the units that carry a big-M, which is what marks a unit as committed rather than merely dispatched |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{min,pu}}$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $p$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

#### Objective

$$\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{marginal\_cost}_{g} + \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{capital\_cost}_{g}$$

#### Subject to

**`within_capacity`**

$$p_{t,g} \le p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`off_means_zero`**

$$p_{t,g} - \mathrm{big\_m}_{g} \cdot \mathit{status}_{t,g} \le 0 \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G} \thinspace:\thinspace \mathrm{big\_m}_{g} \text{ is defined}$$

**`commitment_floor`**

$$p_{t,g} - \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{min,pu}}_{g} \cdot p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} - \mathrm{big\_m}_{g} \cdot \mathit{status}_{t,g} \ge -\mathrm{big\_m}_{g} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G} \thinspace:\thinspace \mathrm{big\_m}_{g} \text{ is defined}$$

**`power_balance`**

$$\sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} = \mathrm{load}_{t} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T}$$

#### Variable domains

**`p`**

$$p_{t,g} \ge 0 \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`p_nom`**

$$0 \le p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \le \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom,max}}_{g} \qquad \forall\thinspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`status`**

$$\mathit{status}_{t,g} \in \{0, 1\} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G} \thinspace:\thinspace \mathrm{big\_m}_{g} \text{ is defined}$$

        """The port's tables as a PyPSA network, column for column.

        ``tables`` is the same mapping the lpspec call attaches as ``sources``.

        ``flex`` is the one asset that is **both** ``committable`` and
        ``p_nom_extendable`` — the intersection this model is about. ``peak`` is
        extendable and not committable, so it is the unit the load falls back on
        when ``flex`` cannot run below its minimum. Both ``*_time_before`` are 0 and
        the start-up and shut-down costs stay at their default 0: the transitions are
        ported by ``pypsa_unit_commitment`` and would give a mismatch here a second
        thing to be about.
        """
        n = pypsa.Network()
        n.set_snapshots(tables['snapshot']['snapshot'])
        n.add('Bus', 'hub')

        generators: pd.DataFrame = tables['generator'].set_index('generator')
        committable = generators.index == 'flex'
        n.add(
            'Generator',
            generators.index,
            bus='hub',
            committable=committable,
            up_time_before=0,
            down_time_before=0,
            p_nom_extendable=True,
            p_min_pu=tables['p_min_pu'].set_index('generator')['value'],
            p_nom_max=tables['p_nom_max'].set_index('generator')['value'],
            marginal_cost=tables['marginal_cost'].set_index('generator')['value'],
            capital_cost=tables['capital_cost'].set_index('generator')['value'],

        return n
    ```

**The commitment binds, and the relaxation says by how much.** `flex` builds 75
and runs 75, 30, 75, 0: at snapshot 1 it sits exactly on its floor
(`0.4 × 75 = 30`), and at snapshot 3 the load of 20 is below that floor, so it
shuts off and `peak` covers. Relax the status to `[0, 1]` on the same rows and
the answer drops to **18200.0** — a third of a power station committed, which is
what the integrality is worth here.

**The big-M is written, not inferred, and that is the ergonomics finding.**
`big_m` is a parameter like any other, and its *presence* is what marks a unit as
committed — the `status` variable and the two commitment rows carry
`where: big_m`. Passing the number costs one column and reads as data, which is
what PyPSA already asks of its own users. What it does not do is check that the
number is large enough: too small a *M* silently cuts the feasible set, exactly
as it would in PyPSA, and [#220](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/issues/220)
is the language half — a big-M derived from the declared `p_nom_max` rather than
supplied beside it.

## PyPSA's own relaxation of this model is not a relaxation

Running the same instance with `linearized_unit_commitment=True` reaches
**32100.0** — *above* the integer 21700.0, with `flex` pinned off in every
snapshot:

```
Generator-com-p-current:       +1 Generator-p[2, flex] - 0 Generator-status[2, flex] <= -0.0
Generator-com-partly-start-up: +1 Generator-p[2, flex] - 1 Generator-p[1, flex] - 0 Generator-status[2, flex] <= -0.0
```

The tightening block PyPSA adds where start-up and shut-down costs match is built
from the `p_nom` **column**, which is 0 for a unit not yet built, so every
coefficient collapses and the rows read `p <= 0`. Filed as
[#989](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/issues/989) to report upstream. It is
why the relaxation quoted above is taken on the port's own model instead.

## What it exercises

A variable masked by the presence of a parameter (`where: big_m` on `status`), a
constant on the right of a `>=` row that only exists where that parameter does,
and the one product in PyPSA's committable set that needs a linearisation
constant rather than a rewrite.
