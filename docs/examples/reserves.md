# reserves

Energy and reserve co-optimization on a two-bus grid: offers are (generator,
market, tranche) triples, reserve zones overlap, and one line dangles. The
model exists to prove a claim — every many-to-many shape the language covers,
in one instance, each one load-bearing.

> **✔ Agrees with hand-written linopy 0.9.0** — objective **915**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

## The problem

A relation either **is an axis** — the pair set reified as a dimension whose
legs are lookups — or **is data** weighting one aggregation. Both appear here.
The offer set is the first kind, three-legged:

$$r_o \;\le\; \phi_{\mathrm{tranche\_of}(o)} \cdot \bar p_{\mathrm{gen\_of}(o)} \qquad \forall\, o$$

a per-offer cap assembled by pulling two other dimensions' parameters back
through two legs of one edge set. The zones are the second kind: membership
with a weight is a sparse parameter, and the zone requirement is the
contraction

$$\sum_{g} \sigma_{g,z} \cdot \Big( \sum_{o \,:\, \mathrm{gen\_of}(o) = g} r_o \Big) \;\ge\; \underline{R}_z \qquad \forall\, z$$

— multiply by the incidence table, sum the dimension away. A generator may
back several zones at different weights, which is exactly what no lookup can
say and no lookup needs to.

<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

Energy and reserve co-optimization on a two-bus grid: an offer is a generator, market and tranche together, reserve zones overlap, and one line dangles. The model exists to prove a claim — every many-to-many shape the language covers, in one instance, each one load-bearing.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathcal{B}$ | index $b$ — `bus` — network nodes |
| $\mathcal{G}$ | index $g$ — `generator` with $\mathrm{gen\_bus}: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{B}$ — generating units, each sitting on one bus |
| $\mathcal{M}$ | index $m$ — `market` — reserve markets, each with a requirement to fill |
| $\mathcal{T}$ | index $t$ — `tranche` — how fast a reserve has to be deliverable |
| $\mathcal{Z}$ | index $z$ — `zone` — reserve zones, which overlap |
| $\mathcal{L}$ | index $l$ — `line` with $\mathrm{line\_from}: \mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{B},\enspace \mathrm{line\_to}: \mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{B}$ — transmission lines, which may have an open end |
| $\mathcal{O}$ | index $o$ — `offer` with $\mathrm{gen\_of}: \mathcal{O} \to \mathcal{G},\enspace \mathrm{market\_of}: \mathcal{O} \to \mathcal{M},\enspace \mathrm{tranche\_of}: \mathcal{O} \to \mathcal{T}$ — one generator's bid into one market at one tranche |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{max}}$ | `p_max` over $\mathcal{G}$ — installed capacity |
| $\mathrm{energy\_cost}$ | `energy_cost` over $\mathcal{G}$ — cost of one unit of output |
| $\mathrm{load}$ | `load` over $\mathcal{B}$ — demand at each bus |
| $\mathrm{cap}$ | `cap` over $\mathcal{L}$ — forward transmission limit |
| $\mathrm{neg\_cap}$ | `neg_cap` over $\mathcal{L}$ — reverse transmission limit |
| $\mathrm{bus\_cap}$ | `bus_cap` over $\mathcal{B}$ — most a bus may export over any one line |
| $\mathrm{offer\_cost}$ | `offer_cost` over $\mathcal{O}$ — cost of holding one unit of reserve on an offer |
| $\mathrm{req}$ | `req` over $\mathcal{M}$ — reserve a market has to be filled with |
| $\mathrm{tranche\_frac}$ | `tranche_frac` over $\mathcal{T}$ — share of capacity a generator may offer at a tranche |
| $\mathrm{zone\_share}$ | `zone_share` over $\mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{Z}$ — how much of a generator's reserve counts towards a zone — a generator may back several zones at a per-zone weight, so this cannot be a lookup over the generator, which is single-valued per label; rows are absent where a generator backs no part of a zone |
| $\mathrm{zone\_req}$ | `zone_req` over $\mathcal{Z}$ — reserve a zone has to be covered by |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $p$ | `p` over $\mathcal{G}$ — output of a generator |
| $f$ | `f` over $\mathcal{L}$ — flow on a line, signed towards its `line_to` bus |
| $r$ | `r` over $\mathcal{O}$ — reserve held against an offer |

#### Definitions

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathit{reserve\_of}$ | `reserve_of` over $\mathcal{G}$ — all the reserve a generator holds, across every offer it made |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{max}}$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $p$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

## What it proves

Present is not proven, so each shape carries the one data mutation that must
move the optimum — held by `tests/test_reserves.py`, alongside the three-way
agreement (both consumers, the written LP file, and the incidence-matrix reference
above; the balance duals are checked too).

| Shape | Where | Idiom | Mutation that moves the optimum |
|---|---|---|---|
| self-relation, used in both directions | lines bus→bus, balance sums through `line_from` and `line_to` | edge dimension + leg lookups | — (the balance is every other row's feasibility) |
| parallel edges | `l1`, `l2` both b2→b1 | member identity is the label, not the endpoint pair | drop `l2` → dearer |
| dangling member | `l4`'s `line_to` is null | a partial lookup: the open end aggregates nowhere | point `l4` at b1 → cheaper |
| pullback through a leg | `f ≤ at(bus_cap, by=line_from)` | `at()` | uncap the exporting bus → cheaper |
| k-ary edge set | offers carry `gen_of`, `market_of`, `tranche_of` | three legs, one edge dimension | — (structure, pinned by test) |
| duplicate pair | `o1`, `o2` share all three legs | multiplicity is real capacity | drop `o2` → dearer |
| two pullbacks through two legs | the offer cap above | `at() * at()` | `o4` sits exactly at its cap |
| weighted n-to-n membership | `zone_share`, `g2` in both zones at 0.5 / 1.0 | incidence parameter, contracted | zero g2's z2 share → dearer |

Zone `z1` stays slack by design: it holds the *overlap* (g2 at weight 0.5)
while `z2` holds the *bindingness*, so the fractional weight is shown without
double-loading one constraint.

## The optimum, by hand

Energy: b2's cheap surplus exports over `l1` (pinned at 15 by `bus_cap`, not
its own 20) and `l2` (its own 8), so `g3` runs 40 local + 23 export = 63 and
`g1` covers the rest of b1, 47 — cost 785. Reserves: `m1`'s 55 takes both
parallel `g1` offers at their 25 caps (`o2` first at cost 1, then `o1` at 2)
plus 5 of `o3`, whose seat on `g2` is also what closes zone `z2` at exactly
25; `m2`'s 20 is `o4` at its tranche cap — cost 130. Total **915**, nodal
prices 10 at b1 and 5 at b2.
