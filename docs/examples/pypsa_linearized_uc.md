# PyPSA linearized unit commitment — the status, relaxed

A unit may be committed by a third. PyPSA ships this as a mode, not as a debugging convenience.

> **✔ Verified against pypsa 1.2.4 (its own linopy 0.9.0)** — objective **5540.0**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

[Unit commitment](pypsa_unit_commitment.md) is a MILP. Its linear relaxation
keeps every constraint exactly where it is and declares the status and the two
transition variables in [0, 1] instead of {0, 1}. The interesting question is
not whether the relaxation is expressible — it obviously is — but whether the
model file can say *both* without duplicating a single row.

It can: three `domain:` lines carry the whole relaxation, and every row the two
models share is byte-identical. They part company in one place, and not over
integrality — this instance starts every unit off, where the integer port takes
PyPSA's default of a unit already running, so the first snapshot's two
transition rows are not the same two rows.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

PyPSA linearized unit commitment: commitment with the status continuous in [0, 1] rather than binary, so a unit may be committed by a third. A relaxation and therefore a bound — on this instance worth less than half the integer answer. Optimum 5540.0, from PyPSA itself.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathcal{T}$ | index $t$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $\mathcal{G}$ | index $g$ — `generator` — generating units, each committed to some degree or not at all |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}$ | `p_nom` over $\mathcal{G}$ — installed capacity of a generator |
| $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{min,pu}}$ | `p_min_pu` over $\mathcal{G}$ — share of capacity a committed unit must produce at least |
| $\mathrm{marginal\_cost}$ | `marginal_cost` over $\mathcal{G}$ — cost of one unit of output |
| $\mathrm{start\_up\_cost}$ | `start_up_cost` over $\mathcal{G}$ — what bringing a unit up costs, once per start |
| $\mathrm{shut\_down\_cost}$ | `shut_down_cost` over $\mathcal{G}$ — what taking a unit down costs, once per stop |
| $\mathrm{load}$ | `load` over $\mathcal{T}$ — demand to be met |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $p$ | `p` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}$ — output of a generator in a snapshot |
| $\mathit{status}$ | `status` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}$ — how far this unit is committed in this snapshot — one of the three declarations that separate this model from the integer one |
| $\mathit{start\_up}$ | `start_up` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}$ — how much of this unit comes up entering this snapshot |
| $\mathit{shut\_down}$ | `shut_down` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}$ — how much of this unit goes down entering this snapshot |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $p$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

$t \boxminus_{v} k$ denotes translation with $v$ standing where index $t-k$ leaves the dimension (`shift(edge=v)`), so the row at that boundary is built and carries $v$ rather than being dropped.

#### Objective

$$\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{marginal\_cost}_{g} + \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}} \mathit{start\_up}_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{start\_up\_cost}_{g} + \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}} \mathit{shut\_down}_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{shut\_down\_cost}_{g}$$

#### Subject to

**`power_balance`**

$$\sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} = \mathrm{load}_{t} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T}$$

**`commitment_max`**

$$p_{t,g} - \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \cdot \mathit{status}_{t,g} \le 0 \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`commitment_min`**

$$p_{t,g} - \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{min,pu}}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \cdot \mathit{status}_{t,g} \ge 0 \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`start_up`**

$$\mathit{start\_up}_{t,g} - \mathit{status}_{t,g} + \mathit{status}_{t \boxminus_{0} 1,g} \ge 0 \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`shut_down`**

$$\mathit{shut\_down}_{t,g} + \mathit{status}_{t,g} - \mathit{status}_{t - 1,g} \ge 0 \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

#### Variable domains

**`p`**

$$p_{t,g} \ge 0 \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`status`**

$$0 \le \mathit{status}_{t,g} \le 1 \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`start_up`**

$$0 \le \mathit{start\_up}_{t,g} \le 1 \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`shut_down`**

$$0 \le \mathit{shut\_down}_{t,g} \le 1 \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

        ``tables`` is the same mapping the lpspec call attaches as ``sources``.

        Nothing here says the model is relaxed: ``committable=True`` is the same
        switch the integer model uses, and the mode is chosen at ``optimize`` time.
        Both ``*_time_before`` are 0, so no status is pinned by a prior horizon.
        """
        n = pypsa.Network()
        n.set_snapshots(tables['snapshot']['snapshot'])
        n.add('Bus', 'hub')

        generators: pd.DataFrame = tables['generator'].set_index('generator')
        n.add(
            'Generator',
            generators.index,
            bus='hub',
            committable=True,

            down_time_before=0,

        )

        n.add('Load', 'l', bus='hub', p_set=tables['load'].set_index('snapshot')['value'])
        return n
    ```

**A bound, not an approximation to be trusted.** The relaxed statuses come out
at 0.3, 0.9, 0.8 and 0.8 — a third of a power station — and the same instance
solved as a MILP costs **11900.0** against this **5540.0**. Less than half. The
gap is what a minimum-output constraint is worth once you are allowed to commit
a fraction of a unit, and it is worth seeing on a model this small.

**This is the only committable model in the corpus with duals.** Integrality
makes a dual solution undefined, so `pypsa_unit_commitment` and
[minimum up and down times](pypsa_min_up_down.md) both record an objective and
nothing else. Relaxing the status turns the model back into an LP, which is most
of why the mode exists — and so this port records a price vector too.

**`base` carries deliberately unequal start-up and shut-down costs.** PyPSA
tightens the relaxation with an extra dispatch-limit block wherever a
generator's two costs *match*, and that block reaches for the ramp-limit
parameters — a second feature. So `base` is left untightened, and PyPSA logs
that it is proceeding without it. `peak` is not: its two costs are both zero, so
PyPSA does emit the tightening there — four blocks of three rows this port has
not got. Every one of them collapses to a row the port already holds, because
`p_min_pu` is 0 and there are no ramp limits: `p ≤ p_nom · status`, or that same
row differenced against the snapshot before. Which is why the objective and the
price vector still agree to `rtol=1e-09` — the two are the same model here by
redundancy, not row for row.

## What it exercises

That integrality is **one declaration on a variable** and nothing above it
cares. Every row the two ports share is byte-identical, and `domain: binary`
against a `[0, 1]` bound is the whole of the relaxation; what else differs is
the first snapshot's initial conditions, which are an instance choice rather
than a consequence of relaxing anything.
