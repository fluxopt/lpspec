# multi_period

Capacity decided once per investment period, binding at every snapshot inside
it — and the periods need not be the same size.

> **✔ Agrees with hand-written linopy 0.9.0** — objective **10020**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

## The problem

$$p_{t,g} \quad\le\quad \hat p_{\thinspace\mathrm{period}(t),\thinspace g}$$

Two dimensions cannot state this at the resolution a real study wants.
`period × snapshot` is a **rectangle**, so every period gets the same number of
snapshots — and a study that models 2030 hourly and 2050 in four-hour blocks is
asking for exactly the opposite.

So `snapshot` is one flat dimension carrying $\mathrm{period}$ as a
[lookup](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/language/dimensions/#lookups), the same way `generator`
carries $\mathrm{bus}$ in [transport](transport.md). Ragged periods then cost
nothing: a lookup is a per-row column, and four snapshots in 2030 beside two in
2050 is just a column with four of one value and two of another.

## Both directions of one mapping

Grouping reads the lookup one way:
`sum(p, by=period_of)` is a per-period CO₂ budget, and
[monthly_budget](monthly_budget.md) is the same construct on a different
lookup.

`within_cap` reads it the other way. Capacity lives on `period` and binds at
each `snapshot`, so a coarse quantity is pulled onto a fine one:

```yaml
within_cap:
  foreach: [snapshot, generator]
  expression: p <= at(p_nom, by=period_of)
```

`at` and `sum(by=)` take the same one argument because the lookup names one
mapping table and the operator says which direction it is walked.

A per-period **parameter** needs neither: data prep can join it onto the
snapshot index before the model sees it. `p_nom` is a **variable**, and a
variable is not data to be joined — which is the line between the two, and why
the pullback is a construct in the language rather than a step before it.

<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

Least-cost investment and dispatch together: capacity is decided once per period and binds at every snapshot inside it, and a snapshot's weight says how much time it stands for, so periods of different size are comparable.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathcal{T}$ | index $t$ — `snapshot` with $\mathrm{period\_of}: \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{E}$ — dispatch periods, each falling in one investment period |
| $\mathcal{E}$ | index $e$ — `period` with $\mathrm{period\_of}: \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{E}$ — investment periods, the grouping capacity is decided over |
| $\mathcal{G}$ | index $g$ — `generator` — generating units |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathrm{load}$ | `load` over $\mathcal{T}$ — demand to be met |
| $\mathrm{weight}$ | `weight` over $\mathcal{T}$ — what one snapshot stands for — a 2050 snapshot represents four hours, so the operating cost of a coarse period is not understated against a fine one |
| $\mathrm{opex}$ | `opex` over $\mathcal{G}$ — cost of running a generator for one snapshot-hour |
| $\mathrm{capex}$ | `capex` over $\mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{E}$ — cost of holding a unit of capacity through a period |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $p$ | `p` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}$ — output of a generator in a snapshot |
| $p^{\mathrm{nom}}$ | `p_nom` over $\mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{G}$ — capacity a generator holds for the whole of a period |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $\mathrm{load}$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $p$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

#### Objective

$$\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{opex}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{weight}_{t} + \sum_{e \in \mathcal{E},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}} p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{e,g} \cdot \mathrm{capex}_{g,e}$$

#### Subject to

**`within_cap`**

$$p_{t,g} \le p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{\mathrm{period\_of}(t),g} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`balance`**

$$\sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} = \mathrm{load}_{t} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T}$$

#### Variable domains

**`p`**

$$p_{t,g} \ge 0 \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`p_nom`**

$$0 \le p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{e,g} \le 100 \qquad \forall\thinspace e \in \mathcal{E},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

## Reading the answer

Costs are chosen so each period picks a different technology, which is what
makes the per-period capacity visible rather than incidental:

| period | wind | gas |
|---|---|---|
| 2030 | 20 | 10 |
| 2050 | 60 | 0 |

2030 peaks at 30 and splits the build — wind is dearer to install but free to
run. 2050 peaks at 60 with every snapshot weighted four times, so the operating
term dominates and the whole build goes to wind. Objective **750.0**, agreed
integer for integer by both lanes.

The weights are the reason the two periods are comparable at all: a coarse
snapshot standing for four hours contributes four hours of operating cost, so a
period is not made cheap by being modelled coarsely.
