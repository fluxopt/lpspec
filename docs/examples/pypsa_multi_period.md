# PyPSA multi-period investment — an asset exists for the years it exists

A build year and a lifetime decide which rows an asset appears in, and each period's costs carry its own discount.

> **✔ Verified against pypsa 1.2.4 (its own linopy 0.9.0)** — objective **85300.0**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

The corpus has a [multi-period](multi_period.md) model already, but not PyPSA's
version of it: no build years, no lifetimes, no discounting, and no asset that
exists in one period and not the next. This model is those four.

Three generators, one of each case. `coal` is built in 2030 with a lifetime of
5 and has retired by 2040; `gas` is built in 2030 and lives through both;
`wind` is built in 2040 and exists in no row before it. All three are built and
all three run, so none is decoration.

| | build year | lifetime | exists in | capacity built |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `coal` | 2030 | 5 | 2030 | 40 |
| `gas` | 2030 | 40 | 2030, 2040 | 60 |
| `wind` | 2040 | 30 | 2040 | 80 |

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

PyPSA multi-period investment: a build year and a lifetime decide which periods an asset exists in, so a generator that has retired has no dispatch to choose, and capacity is paid for once per period it stands in — discounted by that period's weight. One unit retires between the two periods, one is built for the second, one lives through both. Optimum 85300.0, from PyPSA itself.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathcal{T}$ | index $t$ — `snapshot` with $\mathrm{period\_of}: \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{E}$ — dispatch periods, each falling in one investment period |
| $\mathcal{E}$ | index $e$ — `period` — investment periods, the grouping capacity is decided and paid over |
| $\mathcal{G}$ | index $g$ — `generator` — generating units, each existing in some periods and not others |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathrm{load}$ | `load` over $\mathcal{T}$ — demand to be met |
| $\mathrm{period\_weight}$ | `period_weight` over $\mathcal{E}$ — what one period's costs are worth at the horizon's start — the discount that makes a 2040 decision comparable with a 2030 one |
| $\mathrm{opex}$ | `opex` over $\mathcal{G}$ — cost of one unit of output |
| $\mathrm{capex}$ | `capex` over $\mathcal{G}$ — cost of holding one unit of capacity through one period |
| $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom,max}}$ | `p_nom_max` over $\mathcal{G}$ — most capacity a generator may build |
| $\mathrm{activity}$ | `activity` over $\mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{G}$ — 1 where a generator exists in a period and 0 where it does not — PyPSA derives this from a build year and a lifetime, and it decides both what may run and what is paid for |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $p$ | `p` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}$ — output of a generator in a snapshot, held at zero in the snapshots whose period the generator does not exist in |
| $p^{\mathrm{nom}}$ | `p_nom` over $\mathcal{G}$ — capacity built at a generator |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $\mathrm{load}$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $p$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

#### Objective

$$\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{opex}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{period\_weight}_{\mathrm{period\_of}(t)} + \sum_{e \in \mathcal{E},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}} p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{capex}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{activity}_{e,g} \cdot \mathrm{period\_weight}_{e}$$

#### Subject to

**`within_capacity`**

$$p_{t,g} \le p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{activity}_{\mathrm{period\_of}(t),g} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`power_balance`**

$$\sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} = \mathrm{load}_{t} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T}$$

#### Variable domains

**`p`**

$$p_{t,g} \ge 0 \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`p_nom`**

$$0 \le p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \le \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom,max}}_{g} \qquad \forall\thinspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

=== "PyPSA"

    The model-building half of `examples/ports/references/pypsa/pypsa_multi_period.py`:

    ```python
    def build(tables: dict[str, pd.DataFrame]) -> pypsa.Network:
        """The port's tables as a PyPSA network, column for column.

        ``tables`` is the same mapping the lpspec call attaches as ``sources``.

        The port's flat ``snapshot`` axis carries a lookup into ``period``; PyPSA
        wants the same fact as a ``(period, timestep)`` MultiIndex, so the snapshots
        are paired with the period each falls in. ``investment_period_weightings``
        takes the port's ``period_weight`` as its ``objective`` column, and ``years``
        is 10 for both periods — set explicitly, because a default of 1 would make
        the decade an accident rather than a statement.
        """
        n = pypsa.Network()
        snapshots: pd.DataFrame = tables['snapshot']
        periods = list(tables['period']['period'])
        n.set_snapshots(pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([snapshots['period_of'], snapshots['snapshot']]))
        n.investment_periods = periods
        n.investment_period_weightings['years'] = 10
        n.investment_period_weightings['objective'] = tables['period_weight'].set_index('period')['value']

        n.add('Bus', 'hub')
        generators: pd.DataFrame = tables['generator'].set_index('generator')
        n.add(
            'Generator',
            generators.index,
            bus='hub',
            p_nom_extendable=True,
            build_year=[LIFETIMES[g][0] for g in generators.index],
            lifetime=[LIFETIMES[g][1] for g in generators.index],
            p_nom_max=tables['p_nom_max'].set_index('generator')['value'],
            marginal_cost=tables['opex'].set_index('generator')['value'],
            capital_cost=tables['capex'].set_index('generator')['value'],
        )

        load: pd.Series = tables['load'].set_index('snapshot')['value']
        n.add('Load', 'l', bus='hub', p_set=load.to_numpy())
        return n
    ```

**Capacity is paid for once per period the asset stands in.** `gas` is active in
both, so its capital cost enters twice — at 1.0 for 2030 and 0.7 for 2040 —
while `coal` pays once and `wind` pays once, discounted. That is what
`p_nom * capex * activity * period_weight` says: the term is summed over the
`(period, generator)` pairs the activity table holds, which is PyPSA's
`weighted_cost` loop over `investment_period_weightings.objective`
(`optimize.py:322`) written as one product.

**The other weighting does not reach the objective.**
`investment_period_weightings.years` is 10 for both periods here and changes
nothing, because `capital_cost` is given directly rather than annuitised from an
`overnight_cost` (`costs.py:119`). Worth knowing before reading a PyPSA
objective and expecting to find the decade in it — the port carries no `years`
parameter for exactly that reason.

**A retired asset is pinned, not absent — the one place the port and PyPSA
differ in shape.** PyPSA gives `coal` no dispatch variable in 2040 at all
(`Generator-p` is masked to the active pairs). The port keeps the variable and
multiplies its capacity bound by the activity read down through the period
lookup, so `p <= p_nom * 0` holds it at zero. Same optimum, same duals — a
variable pinned to `[0, 0]` contributes nothing — but not the same model on
paper.

Writing the absence exactly would need `where: at(activity, by=period_of)` on
the variable, and a `where:` cannot call `at()`: its grammar compares a name
against a literal. A second table keyed by `(snapshot, generator)` would work
and would state one fact twice, which is worse. So this model is a live consumer
of [#982](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/issues/982), which asks whether a
mask may read a parameter one declared lookup away — or whether the pin is the
answer.

## What it exercises

A second axis over time (`period`) with a lookup down onto the snapshots, a
parameter read through that lookup in both a constraint and the objective, and a
capacity variable whose cost is summed over the periods it exists in rather than
paid once. No construct here is new.
