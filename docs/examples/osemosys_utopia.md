# OSeMOSYS — UTOPIA

What to build and how hard to run it, 1990–2010, to meet three end-use demands at least discounted cost.

> **✔ Verified against OSeMOSYS** — objective **29446.86269**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`. Asserted upstream in `tests/test_gnu_mathprog.py`, and re-run here directly on GLPK.

**The only optimum in this corpus that comes from outside Python.** UTOPIA is
the reference system bundled with MARKAL and the case OSeMOSYS validates itself
against. Its model is GNU MathProg, its solver is GLPK, and neither shares a
line of code, a data model or a language family with anything here — which is
the strongest independence a port can have.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

OSeMOSYS's UTOPIA: what to build and how hard to run it, 1990-2010, to meet three end-use demands at least discounted cost. The reference system bundled with MARKAL. Discounting, the annuity, salvage value and the operational-life window are arithmetic over years, so they are folded into coefficients before the model is built; what is left is the decision. Optimum 29446.86269, from OSeMOSYS itself under GLPK.

#### Sets

#### Parameters

| $\mathit{build}$ | `build` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{V}$ — how much capacity is built, and when |

#### Definitions

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathit{built\_capacity}$ | `built_capacity` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{Y}$ — capacity standing in a year from every vintage still inside its life. A plant's life is read from data and differs by technology, so the window cannot be a fixed shift — it is an incidence table, the shape the KVL port uses for a cycle basis. |
| $\mathit{capacity}$ | `capacity` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{Y}$ — all the capacity standing in a year, including what was already there in 1990 |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $\mathrm{still\_live}$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $\mathit{activity}$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

## What the port had to decide

**An operational life is a window read from data, and that is an incidence
table.** Capacity standing in a year is every vintage still inside its
technology's life — and the lives differ, so this is not a fixed `shift`. The
port carries `still_live[technology, year, vintage]`, one row per pair that is
still live, and the standing capacity is a contraction against it. That is the
same shape [`pypsa_kvl`](pypsa_kvl.md) uses for a cycle basis, and building it
is arithmetic over years, which is where
[the limits](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/limits/#what-counts-as-data-preparation) puts it.

**Discounting, the annuity and salvage value never reach the model.** OSeMOSYS
spends four parameters and four constraint families on them —
`CapitalRecoveryFactor`, `PvAnnuity`, `DiscountFactor`, and `SV1`–`SV4` with
three depreciation cases. Every one is a function of the year and the
technology, so all of it folds into a single coefficient per `(technology,
vintage)`. What survives into the model is the decision: how much to build, and
when.

The one piece that cannot fold is the fixed cost owed on capacity that already
stood in 1990 — it is owed whatever the model chooses, so it enters the
objective as a constant.

## Same answer, a twenty-third of the model

| | rows | columns |
|---|---|---|
| OSeMOSYS, as generated by GLPK | 119,273 | 147,171 |
| this port | 5,124 | 5,733 |

Not a fair fight, and worth being precise about why: OSeMOSYS's long
formulation defines an intermediate *variable* for every accounting quantity —
`RateOfProductionByTechnologyByMode` alone is one per region × timeslice ×
technology × mode × fuel × year — and ties each to its definition with an
equality. Those are not decisions; they are names for expressions. Substituting
them is what any modeller does by hand when the formulation is not being
generated, and it is what writing the model as expressions does automatically.

The point is not that 5,124 beats 119,273. It is that **both reach
29446.86269**, so the substitution is exact, and the smaller model is the one a
reader can hold.

## What this port does not carry

**Storage.** UTOPIA declares a reservoir and OSeMOSYS carries fifteen
constraints for it, but the instance builds none: `NewStorageCapacity` is empty
in the reference solution, as is `Trade`. Their constraints are satisfied at
zero, so the port omits them — and the optimum agreeing to ten digits is what
says the omission was safe.

That has a consequence worth recording, because it was the reason this model
was first proposed for the corpus. `Conversionls`, `Conversionld` and
`Conversionlh` — the three maps from a timeslice to its season, day type and
daily time bracket — appear **only** in those storage constraints. With storage
inert they read nothing, so this port cannot be evidence about grouping one
axis several ways. A model that needs it is still wanted.

## What it exercises

A window read from data as an incidence table; a second axis over the same
years joined to the first; and a cost chain that is entirely data preparation.
No construct here is new — which, for a model of this size from a stack this
far away, is the result.
