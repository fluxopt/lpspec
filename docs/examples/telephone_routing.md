# Routing telephone calls

How many of 425 requested circuits a five-city network can carry at once — and by which routes.

> **✔ Verified against the published optimum** — **380 circuits**, from Guéret, Prins, Sevaux & Heipcke, *Applications of Optimization with Xpress-MP* §12.3.3.

**Both kinds of relation, in one model, each said the way it is.** A path serves
exactly one city pair, so `call_of` is a coordinate and the demand limit groups
through it. A path traverses several arcs, so `uses` is a `(path, arc)` table
and the capacity limit contracts against it. Neither could stand in for the
other: a coordinate is single-valued, and an incidence table cannot be grouped
by.

Five cities, six undirected links, five city pairs asking for circuits, and 17
elementary paths between them. A circuit reserves both directions of every link
it crosses, which is why the network is undirected and the flow carries no sign.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

Routing telephone calls over a five-city network: how many of the 425 requested circuits can be carried at once. A path serves exactly one city pair — a coordinate — and traverses several arcs — an incidence parameter; both relations, each said the way it is. Guéret, Prins, Sevaux and Heipcke, Applications of Optimization with Xpress-MP, section 12.3. Optimum 380 circuits, published in section 12.3.3.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathcal{A}$ | index $a$ — `arc` — an undirected link between two cities, with capacity in circuits |
| $\mathcal{C}$ | index $c$ — `call` with $\mathrm{call\_of}: \mathcal{P} \to \mathcal{C}$ — a city pair with circuits to place |
| $\mathcal{P}$ | index $p$ — `path` with $\mathrm{call\_of}: \mathcal{P} \to \mathcal{C}$ — a route end to end, serving one city pair |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathrm{capacity}$ | `capacity` over $\mathcal{A}$ — circuits an arc can carry |
| $\mathrm{demand}$ | `demand` over $\mathcal{C}$ — circuits a city pair asked for |
| $\mathrm{uses}$ | `uses` over $\mathcal{P} \times \mathcal{A}$ — which arcs a path traverses — a path uses an arc or it does not, so the value is 1 and absence is 0 |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathit{flow}$ | `flow` over $\mathcal{P}$ — circuits carried on a path — integral because a multi-commodity flow is not integral by nature, even though this instance's relaxation happens to be |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $\mathrm{capacity}$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $\mathit{flow}$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

#### Objective

$$\max \sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}} \mathit{flow}_{p}$$

#### Subject to

**`within_demand`**

$$\sum_{p \in \mathcal{P} \thinspace:\thinspace \mathrm{call\_of}(p) = c} \mathit{flow}_{p} \le \mathrm{demand}_{c} \qquad \forall\thinspace c \in \mathcal{C}$$

**`within_capacity`**

$$\sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}} \mathit{flow}_{p} \cdot \mathrm{uses}_{p,a} \le \mathrm{capacity}_{a} \qquad \forall\thinspace a \in \mathcal{A}$$

#### Variable domains

**`flow`**

$$\mathit{flow}_{p} \ge 0, \mathit{flow}_{p} \in \mathbb{Z} \qquad \forall\thinspace p \in \mathcal{P}$$

**Why the answer is 380 and not 425.** Troyes is reachable only over
`troyes_nice` (80) and `troyes_valenciennes` (70), so at most 150 circuits can
terminate there — and Troyes must absorb the 80 Nantes–Troyes and the 70
Paris–Troyes, which is 150 exactly. Valenciennes is reached only over
`paris_valenciennes` (200) and `troyes_valenciennes` (70), capping everything
ending there at 270 against a demand of 175 plus whatever transits. The binding
cut leaves 45 of the Nantes–Troyes circuits unplaced, and the published routing
says the same: 35 of 80 carried.

That is worth stating because the number can be derived before any solver runs,
which is the strongest form a corpus entry can take — the optimum is not merely
somebody else's output, it is arithmetic anybody can check.

## What it exercises

A coordinate and an incidence parameter side by side, each carrying the relation
it fits, in a model neither we nor an energy system wrote. `reserves` already
proves both idioms, but as our own model built to prove them; this is the
outside witness.

Integrality is the source's, not ours: a multi-commodity flow is not integral by
nature, and the book says so before observing that this instance's relaxation
happens to be. A MILP has no dual solution, so the entry records none.
