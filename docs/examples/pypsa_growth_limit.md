# PyPSA growth limit — what may be built depends on what was built last time

A cap on new capacity per investment period, which grows with the period before it. The first `shift` in the corpus along an axis that is not time-of-day.

> **✔ Verified against pypsa 1.2.4 (its own linopy 0.9.0)** — objective **47110.0**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

`Carrier.max_growth` caps how much of a technology may be *newly built* in one
period; `max_relative_growth` adds a share of the previous period's new build to
that allowance, which turns a flat cap into a growth rate
(`global_constraints.py:184`):

```
new[period] - max_relative_growth * new[period - 1] <= max_growth
```

Two things the source settles and the prose around it does not. The quantity on
both sides is **newly built** capacity, not standing capacity —
`vars.where(first_active)` counts an asset in the period it first exists and
never again. And the first period has no predecessor, so its row is the bare
allowance.

The three wind units are one per period, which is how a build year becomes a
column: each is extendable and each first stands in its own period, so
`new[period]` is that unit's capacity.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

PyPSA's carrier growth limit: how much of a technology may be built in one investment period, given how much was built in the one before. Three periods, one capped carrier, and a row that couples each period to its predecessor — the first `shift` in the corpus over an axis that is not time-of-day. Optimum 47110.0, from PyPSA itself.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathcal{T}$ | index $t$ — `snapshot` with $\mathrm{period\_of}: \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{E}$ — dispatch periods, each falling in one investment period |
| $\mathcal{E}$ | index $e$ — `period` — investment periods, the axis capacity is built along |
| $\mathcal{C}$ | index $c$ — `carrier` — what a generator burns, and what a growth limit is a property of |
| $\mathcal{G}$ | index $g$ — `generator` with $\mathrm{gen\_carrier}: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{C},\enspace \mathrm{build\_period}: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{E}$ — generating units, each built in one period and standing from then on |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathrm{load}$ | `load` over $\mathcal{T}$ — demand to be met |
| $\mathrm{period\_weight}$ | `period_weight` over $\mathcal{E}$ — what one period's costs are worth at the horizon's start |
| $\mathrm{opex}$ | `opex` over $\mathcal{G}$ — cost of one unit of output |
| $\mathrm{capex}$ | `capex` over $\mathcal{G}$ — cost of holding one unit of capacity through one period |
| $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom,max}}$ | `p_nom_max` over $\mathcal{G}$ — most capacity a generator may build |
| $\mathrm{activity}$ | `activity` over $\mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{G}$ — 1 where a generator stands in a period and 0 where it does not |
| $\mathrm{capped\_carrier}$ | `capped_carrier` over $\mathcal{C}$ — 1 for the carrier whose growth is capped, 0 for the rest — the selection PyPSA makes by reading its carrier table |
| $\mathrm{max\_growth}$ | `max_growth` (scalar) — most capacity of that carrier that may be newly built in one period |
| $\mathrm{max\_relative\_growth}$ | `max_relative_growth` (scalar) — how much of the previous period's new capacity is added to that allowance — what makes the limit a growth rate rather than a flat cap |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $p$ | `p` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}$ — output of a generator in a snapshot, zero where it does not yet stand |
| $p^{\mathrm{nom}}$ | `p_nom` over $\mathcal{G}$ — capacity built at a generator |

#### Definitions

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathit{new\_capacity}$ | `new_capacity` over $\mathcal{E}$ — capacity of the capped carrier first standing in a period: each generator's capacity counted once, in the period it is built, and never again |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $\mathrm{load}$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $p$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

$t \boxminus_{v} k$ denotes translation with $v$ standing where index $t-k$ leaves the dimension (`shift(edge=v)`), so the row at that boundary is built and carries $v$ rather than being dropped.

#### Objective

$$\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{opex}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{period\_weight}_{\mathrm{period\_of}(t)} + \sum_{e \in \mathcal{E},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}} p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{capex}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{activity}_{e,g} \cdot \mathrm{period\_weight}_{e}$$

#### Subject to

**`within_capacity`**

$$p_{t,g} \le p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{activity}_{\mathrm{period\_of}(t),g} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`power_balance`**

$$\sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} = \mathrm{load}_{t} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T}$$

**`growth_limit`**

$$\mathit{new\_capacity}_{e} - \mathit{new\_capacity}_{e \boxminus_{0} 1} \cdot \mathrm{max\_relative\_growth} \le \mathrm{max\_growth} \qquad \forall\thinspace e \in \mathcal{E}$$

#### Definitions

**`new_capacity`**

$$\mathit{new\_capacity}_{e} = \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G} \thinspace:\thinspace \mathrm{build\_period}(g) = e} p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{capped\_carrier}_{\mathrm{gen\_carrier}(g)} \qquad \forall\thinspace e \in \mathcal{E}$$

#### Variable domains

**`p`**

$$p_{t,g} \ge 0 \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**`p_nom`**

$$0 \le p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \le \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom,max}}_{g} \qquad \forall\thinspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

**The limit binds in every period, and it is worth 4630.** Wind is capped to 15,
then 22.5, then 26.25 — each period's allowance being `15 + 0.5 ×` the last
build — and `gas` grows to 86.25 to cover what wind may not. Drop the two
carrier attributes and the same instance builds 30, 40 and 50 of wind, 30 of gas,
and costs **42480.0** against **47110.0**. The duals on the coupled rows are
−148 and −120.

**`edge=0` keeps the first period's row.** Without it the shifted term is absent
in the first period and the *row* goes with it (a masked variable term deletes
the row rather than zeroing it), where PyPSA emits the bare allowance there:

```
[wind, 2030]: +1 Generator-p_nom[wind_2030]                                  ≤ 15.0
[wind, 2040]: +1 Generator-p_nom[wind_2040] - 0.5 Generator-p_nom[wind_2030] ≤ 15.0
[wind, 2050]: +1 Generator-p_nom[wind_2050] - 0.5 Generator-p_nom[wind_2040] ≤ 15.0
```

**A named expression earns its place here.** `new_capacity` appears twice in one
row — once as itself and once shifted — and writing the grouped sum twice would
be two chances to write it differently. It is the same block `walkthrough`
teaches, used for the reason it exists.

## What it exercises

`shift` over an investment-period axis rather than a snapshot one — the same
operator against a different dimension, which is the claim worth checking
precisely because it looks like it should already work — plus a named expression
used twice in one row, and a capacity grouped onto the period it is built in
through a `build_period` lookup.
