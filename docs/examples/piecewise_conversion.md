# piecewise_conversion

Converters whose flows share one curve, where **how many flows** is data.

> **✔ Agrees with hand-written linopy 0.9.0** — objective **5990**, matched to `rtol=1e-06`.

## The problem

A converter ties its flows together through one operating point: a boiler burns
fuel to make heat, a CHP unit burns fuel to make heat *and* power. The curve is
one convex combination per converter, and the number of expressions it ties is a
property of the system, not of the file — two flows here, three there, and a
unit with a fourth is a row in a table.

$$\mathit{rate}_{f,t} = \sum_{k \in \mathcal{K}_{c(f)}} \lambda_{c(f),t,k}\, v_{f,k} \qquad \forall\thinspace f, t$$

[`piecewise:`](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/language/piecewise/) cannot say that: its `links:`
are a list, so the arity would have to be written out. **The formulation it
would have emitted is four declarations**, and each is ordinary:

| what | how |
|---|---|
| the weights | a variable over `[converter, time, bp]`, masked by `where: bp_present` |
| on one segment | [`sos:`](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/language/piecewise/#sos) `type: 2` over that variable |
| one operating point | `sum(weight, over=bp) == 1` |
| the tie | one row per **flow**, reading its converter's weights through `at(…, by=converter_of)` |

Least-cost heat and power from two converters whose flows are tied to one piecewise curve each — a boiler tying two flows, a CHP unit tying three, and neither number written anywhere in the file.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathcal{T}$ | index $t$ — `time` — dispatch periods |
| $\mathcal{C}$ | index $c$ — `converter` — units converting one carrier into others |
| $\mathcal{F}$ | index $f$ — `flow` with $\mathrm{converter\_of}: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{C}$ — a converter's inputs and outputs, one row each |
| $\mathcal{B}$ | index $b$ — `bp` — breakpoints, as many as the longest curve needs |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathrm{bp\_rate}$ | `bp_rate` over $\mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{B}$ — what each flow runs at, at each breakpoint of its converter's curve |
| $\mathrm{bp\_present}$ | `bp_present` over $\mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{B}$ — how far each converter's curve runs |
| $\mathrm{rate}^{\mathrm{max}}$ | `rate_max` over $\mathcal{F}$ — what each flow runs at when its converter is at its last breakpoint |
| $\mathrm{is\_heat}$ | `is_heat` over $\mathcal{F}$ — which flows deliver heat |
| $\mathrm{is\_power}$ | `is_power` over $\mathcal{F}$ — which flows deliver power |
| $\mathrm{fuel\_price}$ | `fuel_price` over $\mathcal{F}$ — what a unit of each input flow costs |
| $\mathrm{heat\_demand}$ | `heat_demand` over $\mathcal{T}$ — heat to be delivered |
| $\mathrm{power\_demand}$ | `power_demand` over $\mathcal{T}$ — power to be delivered |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathit{rate}$ | `rate` over $\mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{T}$ — what each flow runs at |
| $\mathit{weight}$ | `weight` over $\mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{B}$ — how much of each breakpoint the converter's operating point is made of — one convex combination per converter and period, over the breakpoints its own curve runs to |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $\mathrm{bp\_rate}$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $\mathit{rate}$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

#### Objective

$$\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \sum_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \mathit{rate}_{f,t} \cdot \mathrm{fuel\_price}_{f}$$

#### Subject to

**`one_operating_point`**

$$\sum_{b \in \mathcal{B}} \mathit{weight}_{c,t,b} = 1 \qquad \forall\thinspace c \in \mathcal{C},\enspace t \in \mathcal{T}$$

**`on_the_curve`**

$$\mathit{rate}_{f,t} = \sum_{b \in \mathcal{B}} \mathit{weight}_{\mathrm{converter\_of}(f),t,b} \cdot \mathrm{bp\_rate}_{f,b} \qquad \forall\thinspace f \in \mathcal{F},\enspace t \in \mathcal{T}$$

**`heat_balance`**

$$\sum_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \mathit{rate}_{f,t} \cdot \mathrm{is\_heat}_{f} = \mathrm{heat\_demand}_{t} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T}$$

**`power_balance`**

$$\sum_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \mathit{rate}_{f,t} \cdot \mathrm{is\_power}_{f} = \mathrm{power\_demand}_{t} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T}$$

#### Variable domains

**`rate`**

$$0 \le \mathit{rate}_{f,t} \le \mathrm{rate}^{\mathrm{max}}_{f} \qquad \forall\thinspace f \in \mathcal{F},\enspace t \in \mathcal{T}$$

**`weight`**

$$0 \le \mathit{weight}_{c,t,b} \le 1 \qquad \forall\thinspace c \in \mathcal{C},\enspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace b \in \mathcal{B} \thinspace:\thinspace \mathrm{bp\_present}_{c,b}$$

**`weight sos`**

$$\left( \mathit{weight}_{c,t,b} \right)_{b \in \mathcal{B}} \in \mathrm{SOS}2 \qquad \forall\thinspace c \in \mathcal{C},\enspace t \in \mathcal{T}$$

## What it exercises

**The arity is a row count.** `on_the_curve` builds one row per flow, so a
converter tying three expressions and one tying two are the same declaration.
Nothing in the file says how many flows a converter has; the `converter_of`
lookup does, and it is data.

**The mask is the variable's own.** `where: bp_present` decides which weights
exist, and an [`sos:`](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/language/piecewise/#sos) set is over the
members present — so the boiler's three-breakpoint curve and the CHP's four sit
on one axis with nothing padded. A solver without SOS gets binaries and big-M
rows for the same set, which is why `big_m: 1` is there: a weight is at most 1.

The comparison is worth reading in the other tab. linopy ties N expressions to
one basis too — that is what `add_piecewise_formulation` does — but the pairs
are an argument list, so the arity is written out per converter in a Python
loop. That loop is what moves into the data here.
