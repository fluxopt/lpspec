# PyPSA energy totals — a bound across the whole horizon

A generator's dispatch reduced over every snapshot and bounded: a contracted delivery, a reservoir's season.

> **✔ Verified against pypsa 1.2.4 (its own linopy 0.9.0)** — objective **21400.0**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

Every other bound in the corpus holds *within* one snapshot. `e_sum_min` and
`e_sum_max` hold across all of them at once, which is how a fuel allowance, a
take-or-pay contract and a hydro reservoir's season are all written.

Three generators, two bounds. `hydro` is cheapest but capped at 200 MWh;
`contract` is dearest yet owes 150 MWh whatever the merit order says; `gas` is
free to balance. Both bounds bind, and they bind in opposite directions.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

PyPSA energy-total bounds: a generator's dispatch reduced over the whole horizon and bounded — a contracted delivery on one, a reservoir's season on another, and a third free to balance. Optimum 21400.0, from PyPSA itself.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathcal{T}$ | index $t$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $\mathcal{B}$ | index $b$ — `bus` with $\mathrm{gen\_bus}: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{B}$ — network nodes |
| $\mathcal{G}$ | index $g$ — `generator` with $\mathrm{gen\_bus}: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{B}$ — generating units, each sitting on one bus |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathrm{weighting}$ | `weighting` over $\mathcal{T}$ — hours a snapshot stands for — what turns a power into an energy |
| $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}$ | `p_nom` over $\mathcal{G}$ — installed capacity of a generator |
| $\mathrm{marginal\_cost}$ | `marginal_cost` over $\mathcal{G}$ — cost of one unit of output |
| $\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{sum,max}}$ | `e_sum_max` over $\mathcal{G}$ — most energy a generator may deliver over the whole horizon, for the generators that have such a limit |
| $\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{sum,min}}$ | `e_sum_min` over $\mathcal{G}$ — least energy a generator must deliver over the whole horizon, for the generators that owe one |
| $\mathrm{load}$ | `load` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{B}$ — demand at each bus in each snapshot |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $p$ | `p` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}$ — output of a generator in a snapshot |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $\mathrm{weighting}$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $p$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

#### Objective

$$\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{marginal\_cost}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{weighting}_{t}$$

#### Subject to

**`nodal_balance`**

$$\sum_{g \in \mathcal{G} \thinspace:\thinspace \mathrm{gen\_bus}(g) = b} p_{t,g} = \mathrm{load}_{t,b} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace b \in \mathcal{B}$$

**`energy_cap`**

$$\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} p_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{weighting}_{t} \le \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{sum,max}}_{g} \qquad \forall\thinspace g \in \mathcal{G} \thinspace:\thinspace \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{sum,max}}_{g} \text{ is defined}$$

**`energy_floor`**

$$\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} p_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{weighting}_{t} \ge \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{sum,min}}_{g} \qquad \forall\thinspace g \in \mathcal{G} \thinspace:\thinspace \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{sum,min}}_{g} \text{ is defined}$$

#### Variable domains

**`p`**

$$0 \le p_{t,g} \le \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \qquad \forall\thinspace t \in \mathcal{T},\enspace g \in \mathcal{G}$$

=== "PyPSA"

    The model-building half of `examples/ports/references/pypsa/pypsa_energy_sum.py`:

    ```python
    def build(tables: dict[str, pd.DataFrame]) -> pypsa.Network:
        """The port's tables as a PyPSA network, column for column.

        ``tables`` is the same mapping the lpspec call attaches as ``sources``.

        The energy bounds arrive as short frames — one row per generator that has
        one — and are reindexed onto the full generator index, which is where the
        infinities PyPSA tests for come from. All three weighting columns are set
        together: ``generators`` scales the energy the bounds see, ``objective``
        scales the cost, and leaving them to disagree would make the number an
        accident of a default.
        """
        n = pypsa.Network()
        n.set_snapshots(tables['snapshot']['snapshot'])
        n.snapshot_weightings.loc[:, :] = tables['weighting'].set_index('snapshot')['value'].to_numpy()[:, None]
        n.add('Bus', tables['bus']['bus'])

        generators: pd.DataFrame = tables['generator'].set_index('generator')
        e_sum_max = tables['e_sum_max'].set_index('generator')['value'].reindex(generators.index, fill_value=float('inf'))
        e_sum_min = tables['e_sum_min'].set_index('generator')['value'].reindex(generators.index, fill_value=float('-inf'))
        n.add(
            'Generator',
            generators.index,
            bus=generators['gen_bus'],
            p_nom=tables['p_nom'].set_index('generator')['value'],
            marginal_cost=tables['marginal_cost'].set_index('generator')['value'],
            e_sum_max=e_sum_max,

        )

        load: pd.DataFrame = tables['load'].pivot(index='snapshot', columns='bus', values='value')
        for bus in tables['bus']['bus']:

        return n
    ```

**A bound only some rows have is written, not inferred.** PyPSA defaults the two
attributes to ±∞ and emits a row only where the value is finite. Here the tables
are short — one row in `e_sum_max`, one in `e_sum_min` — and the constraint
carries `where: e_sum_max`. Leaving the `where:` off is refused at load time,
with the reason spelled out: a missing row on a comparison's constant side would
*be* the bound, so `x <= 0` would bind where the model said nothing. The two
readings build different models, so neither is guessed.

**The snapshot weightings are not 1, and that changes what a dual means.** They
are the hours each snapshot stands for, and they enter twice — once in the
energy the bounds see, once in the cost. PyPSA divides the nodal-balance dual by
the objective weighting before publishing it as `marginal_price`, so its figure
reads per unit energy: a flat **60** against a dual of **60, 120, 180, 120**.
Every model above weights its snapshots 1 and hides the division entirely. The
recorded reference is the dual, because that is the object both models hold —
the port asserts the formulation, not the presentation.

## What it exercises

A reduction over a dimension the constraint does not span: `sum(p * weighting,
over=snapshot)` with `foreach: [generator]`. The `where:` masking a row to where
its bound exists, on both a `<=` and a `>=`. And a parameter that multiplies
inside a reduction and again in the objective.
