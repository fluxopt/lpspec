# PyPSA link delay — power that arrives later than it left

A shipment is the input shifted along time: withdrawn at one snapshot, delivered at another, derated on the way.

> **✔ Verified against pypsa 1.2.4 (its own linopy 0.9.0)** — objective **4311.111111111111**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

Every `shift` in the corpus so far relates a variable to *itself* — a ramp
limit, a state of charge. Here it relates two buses' balances: what `port_a`
gives up in snapshot 0 is what `port_b` receives in snapshot 2, times the link's
efficiency.

Two links serve the same demand, and the delay is a column, not a constant:
`ship` takes two snapshots and loses 10%, `wire` arrives at once and loses
nothing. So the first two snapshots at `port_b` have nothing shipped to them yet
and are served by the expensive unit standing beside the load — which is what
makes the delay cost something.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

PyPSA's delayed link: power withdrawn at one snapshot arrives at a later one, so a shipment is the input shifted along time and derated by the link's efficiency. Two links serve the same demand — one takes two snapshots to arrive, one arrives at once — and the first snapshots, which nothing has reached yet, are served by the expensive unit standing beside the load. Optimum 4311.111111111111, from PyPSA itself.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathcal{T}`$ | index $`t`$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $`\mathcal{B}`$ | index $`b`$ — `bus` — network nodes |
| $`\mathcal{E}`$ | index $`e`$ — `generator` with $`\mathrm{gen\_bus}: \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}`$ — generating units, each sitting on one bus |
| $`\mathcal{L}`$ | index $`l`$ — `link` with $`\mathrm{link\_from}: \mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{B},\ \mathrm{link\_to}: \mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{B}`$ — controllable connections, each joining two buses |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}`$ | `p_nom` over $`\mathcal{E}`$ — installed capacity of a generator |
| $`\mathrm{marginal\_cost}`$ | `marginal_cost` over $`\mathcal{E}`$ — cost of one unit of output |
| $`\mathrm{link\_p\_nom}`$ | `link_p_nom` over $`\mathcal{L}`$ — most a link may take in during one snapshot |
| $`\mathrm{efficiency}`$ | `efficiency` over $`\mathcal{L}`$ — share of what entered a link that arrives at the other end |
| $`\mathrm{delay}`$ | `delay` over $`\mathcal{L}`$ — how many snapshots a link takes to deliver what it took in |
| $`\mathrm{load}`$ | `load` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{B}`$ — demand at each bus in each snapshot |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`p`$ | `p` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{E}`$ — output of a generator in a snapshot |
| $`g`$ | `g` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{L}`$ — what a link takes in during a snapshot, at the bus it leaves |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}`$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $`p`$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

$`t \boxminus_{v} k`$ denotes translation with $`v`$ standing where index $`t-k`$ leaves the dimension (`shift(edge=v)`), so the row at that boundary is built and carries $`v`$ rather than being dropped.

#### Objective

```math
\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\ e \in \mathcal{E}} p_{t,e} \cdot \mathrm{marginal\_cost}_{e}
```

#### Subject to

**`nodal_balance`**

```math
\sum_{e \in \mathcal{E} \,:\, \mathrm{gen\_bus}(e) = b} p_{t,e} + \sum_{l \in \mathcal{L} \,:\, \mathrm{link\_to}(l) = b} g_{t \boxminus_{0} \mathrm{delay},l} \cdot \mathrm{efficiency}_{l} - \left( \sum_{l \in \mathcal{L} \,:\, \mathrm{link\_from}(l) = b} g_{t,l} \right) = \mathrm{load}_{t,b} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ b \in \mathcal{B}
```

#### Variable domains

**`p`**

```math
0 \le p_{t,e} \le \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}_{e} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ e \in \mathcal{E}
```

**`g`**

```math
0 \le g_{t,l} \le \mathrm{link\_p\_nom}_{l} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ l \in \mathcal{L}
```

        """The port's tables as a PyPSA network, column for column.

        ``tables`` is the same mapping the lpspec call attaches as ``sources``.

        Both links are given a ``delay`` — 2 for ``ship`` and 0 for ``wire`` — so the
        column is read rather than a constant applied to everything, and neither
        link is extendable: a delay is about *when* energy arrives, and a capacity
        decision would give a mismatch a second thing to be about.
        """
        n = pypsa.Network()
        n.set_snapshots(tables['snapshot']['snapshot'])
        n.add('Bus', tables['bus']['bus'])

        generators: pd.DataFrame = tables['generator'].set_index('generator')
        n.add(
            'Generator',
            generators.index,
            bus=generators['gen_bus'],
            p_nom=tables['p_nom'].set_index('generator')['value'],
            marginal_cost=tables['marginal_cost'].set_index('generator')['value'],
        )

        links: pd.DataFrame = tables['link'].set_index('link')
        n.add(
            'Link',
            links.index,
            bus0=links['link_from'],
            bus1=links['link_to'],

            delay=tables['delay'].set_index('link')['value'],
            cyclic_delay=False,
        )

        load: pd.DataFrame = tables['load'].pivot(index='snapshot', columns='bus', values='value')
        for bus in tables['bus']['bus']:
            n.add('Load', f'load_{bus}', bus=bus, p_set=load[bus])
        return n
    ```

**`cyclic_delay=False` is `edge=0`, one for one.** PyPSA's own attribute table
says of the non-cyclic case that *energy is lost at the tail and first snapshots
receive nothing from delayed links*. That is exactly what `edge=0` states: the
vacated positions contribute zero. The cyclic case is `edge='wrap'`, which
[cyclic storage](pypsa_cyclic_storage.md) already ports on a different
component, so this model takes the non-cyclic one — the case with a boundary to say something
about.

The language **refuses** a per-entity shift with no `edge=` at all:

```
LanguageError: constraint 'nodal_balance': shift(offset=delay) leaves the vacated
positions absent, which a per-entity offset cannot say yet.
Add edge='wrap' for a cyclic translation, or edge=<number> for what the vacated
positions contribute.
```

Which is the right refusal here: PyPSA does not leave those positions absent, it
zeroes them, and the two readings build different models.

**Both ends of the horizon show.** Shipments of 44.44 leave in snapshots 0 and 1
and arrive as 40 in snapshots 2 and 3; nothing is shipped in snapshots 4 and 5,
because it would arrive after the horizon ends and be lost. The prices say the
same thing: `port_b` pays 100 while it waits, then 11.11 — the cheap unit's 10
divided by the ship's 0.9.

## What it exercises

`shift(x, over=dim, offset=p, edge=0)` with `p` an integer column, inside a grouped
sum that lands on a *different* entity's row — the first model in the corpus
where a shift moves a quantity between two places rather than along one.
