# walkthrough

The dispatch model plus a macro and a named expression — the one used to print every pipeline stage.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

The dispatch model of README.md, plus one macro and one named expression — small enough to print in full, complete enough that every pipeline stage in examples/walkthrough.py has something to show.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathcal{S}`$ | index $`s`$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $`\mathcal{G}`$ | index $`g`$ — `generator` — generating units, including oil, which is retired and gets no columns at all |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\bar p`$ | `p_max` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — installed capacity, zero for a retired unit |
| $`\ell`$ | `load` over $`\mathcal{S}`$ — demand to be met |
| $`c`$ | `cost` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — marginal cost |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`p`$ | `p` over $`\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — output of a generator in a snapshot — the `where` drops the retired unit entirely, so the built model is smaller than the coordinate product |

#### Definitions

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathit{total\_supply}`$ | `total_supply` over $`\mathcal{S}`$ — what the whole fleet produces in a snapshot |

#### Objective

```math
\min \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{s,g} \cdot c_{g}
```

#### Subject to

**`power_balance`**

```math
\mathit{total\_supply}_{s} = \ell_{s} \qquad \forall\, s \in \mathcal{S}
```

#### Definitions

**`total_supply`**

```math
\mathit{total\_supply}_{s} = \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{s,g} \qquad \forall\, s \in \mathcal{S}
```

#### Variable domains

**`p`**

```math
0 \le p_{s,g} \le \bar p_{g} \qquad \forall\, s \in \mathcal{S},\ g \in \mathcal{G} \,:\, \bar p_{g} > 0
```

## What it exercises

This is the model behind `python examples/walkthrough.py`, which runs it
through every stage — YAML → schema → core AST → logical plan → model frames →
LP text → solution — printing what each stage produces, then two models the
language refuses and why. The committed output is
[examples/walkthrough.out](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/blob/main/examples/walkthrough.out)
if you would rather read than run.

It is the only model here that uses **tier 2**: a macro and a named
expression. The macro does not survive the language's expansion — nothing
downstream of `math_spec` knows it existed, which is what makes it free. The named
expression is substituted the same way wherever a constraint uses it, but its
name survives on the model: stage 6 reads `total_supply` back at the solution
with `expression()`, lowered on that read rather than at build, so declaring
it still costs the build nothing.
