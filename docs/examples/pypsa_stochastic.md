# PyPSA stochastic optimisation — capacity once, dispatch per future

Three futures over one network: the fleet is built before anyone knows which arrives, and dispatched after.

> **✔ Verified against pypsa 1.2.4 (its own linopy 0.9.0)** — objective **33940.0**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

`n.set_scenarios` makes a network stochastic, and what it does is add one
dimension to some variables and not others:

```
Generator-p_nom  ('name',)
Generator-p      ('scenario', 'name', 'snapshot')
```

That is the whole two-stage program. Capacity is a **first-stage** decision — one
number per generator, spanning no scenario, because it is taken while all three
futures are still open. Dispatch is **second stage**, one per future, chosen once
the load is known. `define_objective` then runs every term through `_expected`,
which selects each scenario and multiplies it by that scenario's weight
(`optimize.py:361`).

The three futures differ in one thing, the load:

| | probability | snapshot 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mild` | 0.6 | 100 | 120 | 90 |
| `cold` | 0.3 | 130 | 160 | 110 |
| `severe` | 0.1 | 170 | 210 | 140 |

`base` costs 150 to build and 10 to run, `peak` 120 and 70 — so the mix, not just
the total, is what the expectation decides.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

PyPSA stochastic optimisation: one network and three futures, where capacity is chosen once and dispatch is chosen after the load is known. The two stages differ only in which dimension they span — the capacity variable has no scenario, the dispatch variable does — and the objective is the probability-weighted expectation over them. Optimum 33940.0, from PyPSA itself.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathcal{S}`$ | index $`s`$ — `scenario` — the futures the fleet is built against, one of which will happen |
| $`\mathcal{T}`$ | index $`t`$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods, the same in every future |
| $`\mathcal{G}`$ | index $`g`$ — `generator` — generating units, each built once and run in every future |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathrm{probability}`$ | `probability` over $`\mathcal{S}`$ — how likely a future is — the weights the expectation is taken with |
| $`\mathrm{load}`$ | `load` over $`\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{T}`$ — demand to be met, and the one thing that differs between futures |
| $`\mathrm{capex}`$ | `capex` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — cost of holding one unit of capacity over the horizon |
| $`\mathrm{opex}`$ | `opex` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — cost of one unit of output |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`p^{\mathrm{nom}}`$ | `p_nom` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — capacity built at a generator — the first-stage decision, which spans no scenario because it is taken before anyone knows which future arrived |
| $`p`$ | `p` over $`\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — output of a generator in a snapshot of a future — the second-stage decision, one per scenario |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $`\mathrm{probability}`$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $`p^{\mathrm{nom}}`$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

#### Objective

```math
\min \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S},\ t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{s,t,g} \cdot \mathrm{opex}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{probability}_{s} + \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{capex}_{g}
```

#### Subject to

**`within_capacity`**

```math
p_{s,t,g} \le p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \qquad \forall\, s \in \mathcal{S},\ t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}
```

**`power_balance`**

```math
\sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{s,t,g} = \mathrm{load}_{s,t} \qquad \forall\, s \in \mathcal{S},\ t \in \mathcal{T}
```

#### Variable domains

**`p_nom`**

```math
p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \ge 0 \qquad \forall\, g \in \mathcal{G}
```

**`p`**

```math
p_{s,t,g} \ge 0 \qquad \forall\, s \in \mathcal{S},\ t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}
```

        time-varying input once the network is stochastic. Both generators are

**The expectation is doing work, and here is what it is worth.** Collapse the
three futures into their probability-weighted mean load — 116, 141, 101 — and the
same network builds **141 MW of `base` and no `peak` at all**, for 24730.0. That
fleet has no dispatch in the severe future, which asks for 210: the
expected-value model does not merely cost less, it answers a question nobody
posed. `what_the_mean_would_build()` in the reference prints it.

**One capacity, three scenarios of rows.** `within_capacity` is `p <= p_nom` with
a `foreach` of `[scenario, snapshot, generator]` against a variable declared over
`[generator]` — nine rows reading one column, which is how a first-stage decision
is coupled to a second-stage one. Nothing in the language had to learn about
stages: the dim algebra broadcasts the capacity because the constraint's frame
says to.

**Prices carry the probability, and they add up to the capital cost.** The nodal
price in `mild` is 6.0 rather than 10.0, because the term it prices is weighted
by 0.6 — a PyPSA user reading `marginal_price` off a stochastic network is
reading a *weighted* price, and both implementations agree on that. The scarcity
rents are where the two stages meet:

| | snapshot 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mild` | 6 | 6 | 6 |
| `cold` | 3 | **21** | 3 |
| `severe` | 7 | **127** | 1 |

`base` is at its capacity in three cells, and the rents there — 18 in `cold`, 6
and 126 in `severe` — sum to 150, its cost to build. `peak` is at capacity in one
cell, and its rent there is 120, its cost to build. A capacity that is chosen
once is paid for by every future that runs it out.

## What it exercises

Two variables that deliberately span different dimensions, coupled by a
constraint whose frame is the wider of the two, and an objective that reduces one
of them against a probability. The claim is not that the math is hard — it is
that *structure comes from data*: nothing here declares a stage, and the two
stages are visible only in which dimensions each `foreach` lists.
