# piecewise_ragged

Per-generator cost curves of **different lengths**, each as long as its own data.

> **✔ Agrees with hand-written linopy 0.9.0** — objective **426**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

## The problem

A breakpoint dimension is one axis for the whole system, but a curve is per
unit. The hydro unit here has two breakpoints, the coal plant three, the gas
turbine four. Nothing in the model has to know which is longest.

$$p_{t,g} = \sum_{k \in \mathcal{K}_g} \lambda_{t,g,k}\, x_{g,k}, \quad
\mathrm{cost}_{t,g} \ge \sum_{k \in \mathcal{K}_g} \lambda_{t,g,k}\, y_{g,k}, \quad
\sum_{k \in \mathcal{K}_g} \lambda_{t,g,k} = 1$$

The weights run over $\mathcal{K}_g$, the curve's own breakpoint set, which
is what `points: bp_x` says. Without it the shorter curves have to be padded
out to the longest. Padding buys a weight per unused breakpoint, and
`method: convex` refuses it, because a repeated point is not a strictly
increasing breakpoint.

<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

Least-cost dispatch where each generator's cost curve has as many breakpoints as its data gives it — two for the hydro unit, four for the gas turbine — rather than as many as the longest curve in the system.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathcal{T}`$ | index $`t`$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $`\mathcal{G}`$ | index $`g`$ — `generator` — dispatchable units |
| $`\mathcal{B}`$ | index $`b`$ — `bp` — breakpoints, as many as the longest curve needs |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{max}}`$ | `p_max` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — maximum dispatch |
| $`\mathrm{load}`$ | `load` over $`\mathcal{T}`$ — demand to be met |
| $`\mathrm{bp\_x}`$ | `bp_x` over $`\mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{B}`$ — breakpoint dispatch levels, one curve per generator and no two the same length |
| $`\mathrm{bp\_y}`$ | `bp_y` over $`\mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{B}`$ — cost at each breakpoint |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`p`$ | `p` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — dispatched power |
| $`\mathit{op\_cost}`$ | `op_cost` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — operating cost, piecewise-linear in dispatch |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{max}}`$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $`p`$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

$`t \boxminus_{v} k`$ denotes translation with $`v`$ standing where index $`t-k`$ leaves the dimension (`shift(edge=v)`), so the row at that boundary is built and carries $`v`$ rather than being dropped.

#### Objective

```math
\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}} \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} \mathit{op\_cost}_{t,g}
```

#### Subject to

**`balance`**

```math
\sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} = \mathrm{load}_{t} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T}
```

**`cost_curve`**

```math
\mathit{op\_cost}_{t,g} \ge \mathrm{conv}_{b \in \mathcal{B} \,:\, \mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b} \text{ is defined}}(\mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b},\ \mathrm{bp\_y}_{g,b})(p_{t,g}) \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}
```

#### Variable domains

**`p`**

```math
0 \le p_{t,g} \le \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{max}}_{g} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}
```

**`op_cost`**

```math
\mathit{op\_cost}_{t,g} \ge 0 \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}
```

```

**`cost_curve_increasing`**

```math
\mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b \boxminus_{0} 1} < \mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b} \qquad \forall\, g \in \mathcal{G},\ b \in \mathcal{B} \,:\, \mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b} \text{ is defined} \wedge \mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b - 1} \text{ is defined}
```

**`cost_curve_curvature`**

```math
\left( \mathrm{bp\_y}_{g,b} - \mathrm{bp\_y}_{g,b \boxminus_{0} 1} \right) \cdot \left( \mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b \boxplus_{0} 1} - \mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b} \right) \le \left( \mathrm{bp\_y}_{g,b \boxplus_{0} 1} - \mathrm{bp\_y}_{g,b} \right) \cdot \left( \mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b} - \mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b \boxminus_{0} 1} \right) \qquad \forall\, g \in \mathcal{G},\ b \in \mathcal{B} \,:\, \mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b} \text{ is defined} \wedge \mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b - 1} \text{ is defined} \wedge \mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b + 1} \text{ is defined}
```

**`cost_curve_contiguous`**

```math
\lvert \{ b \in \mathcal{B} \,:\, \mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b} \text{ is defined} \wedge \neg \left( \mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b - 1} \text{ is defined} \right) \} \rvert = 1 \qquad \forall\, g \in \mathcal{G}

        m = linopy.Model()
        p = m.add_variables(lower=0, upper=reach, coords=[load.index, p_max.index], name='p')

                    op_cost.sel(generator=g) - slope * p.sel(generator=g) >= intercept,

                )
        m.add_constraints(p.sum('generator') == load, name='balance')
        m.add_objective(op_cost.sum())
        return m
    ```

## What it exercises

**`points:` is what makes the curve its own.** The weights, and the segment
binaries where a method declares them, exist only where the mask does, so the
hydro unit carries two rather than four. No value is asked for at a breakpoint
the curve leaves out. A gap in the middle of a curve is refused when data
attaches: the marked breakpoints have to follow one another, though they need
not start at the head of the axis.

The linopy reference reaches the same optimum from the **other** formulation:
segment lines rather than weights, which is exact for a convex curve under
minimisation and needs no auxiliary variable. Two formulations agreeing is a
stronger check than two spellings of one. Both sides stay a pure LP, so this
model keeps its duals.
