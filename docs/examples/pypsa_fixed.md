# PyPSA fixed by data — a schedule, and a capacity already decided

A row of data that is present pins its variable; a row that is absent leaves it free.

> **✔ Verified against pypsa 1.2.4 (its own linopy 0.9.0)** — objective **49900.0**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

`p_set` pins a dispatch, `p_nom_set` pins a capacity, and each equality exists
only where the table has a row: the must-run unit, the pre-committed schedule,
the capacity somebody already signed for.

`chp` is the dearest generator in the fleet and still runs in the two snapshots
it is scheduled in. That is the direction that matters — a fixing which only
ever agreed with the merit order would never show up in the objective.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

PyPSA dispatch and capacity fixed by data: a row that is present pins its variable, a row that is absent leaves it free. A must-run unit runs in the two snapshots it is pinned in even though it is the dearest in the fleet. Optimum 49900.0, from PyPSA itself.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathcal{T}`$ | index $`t`$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $`\mathcal{B}`$ | index $`b`$ — `bus` with $`\mathrm{gen\_bus}: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{B}`$ — network nodes |
| $`\mathcal{G}`$ | index $`g`$ — `generator` with $`\mathrm{gen\_bus}: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{B}`$ — generating units, each sitting on one bus |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom,max}}`$ | `p_nom_max` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — most capacity that may stand at a generator once built |
| $`\mathrm{capital\_cost}`$ | `capital_cost` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — cost of holding one unit of capacity over the horizon |
| $`\mathrm{marginal\_cost}`$ | `marginal_cost` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — cost of one unit of output |
| $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom,set}}`$ | `p_nom_set` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — the capacity a generator is to hold, for the generators whose capacity is already decided |
| $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{set}}`$ | `p_set` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — the output a generator is to deliver, for the snapshots in which it is scheduled rather than chosen |
| $`\mathrm{load}`$ | `load` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{B}`$ — demand at each bus in each snapshot |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`p`$ | `p` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — output of a generator in a snapshot |
| $`p^{\mathrm{nom}}`$ | `p_nom` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — capacity built at a generator |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom,max}}`$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $`p`$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

#### Objective

```math
\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{marginal\_cost}_{g} + \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \cdot \mathrm{capital\_cost}_{g}
```

#### Subject to

**`within_capacity`**

```math
p_{t,g} \le p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}
```

**`capacity_fixed`**

p^{\mathrm{nom}}_{g} = \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom,set}}_{g} \qquad \forall\, g \in \mathcal{G} \,:\, \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom,set}}_{g} \text{ is defined}
```

**`dispatch_fixed`**

```math
p_{t,g} = \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{set}}_{t,g} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G} \,:\, \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{set}}_{t,g} \text{ is defined}
```

**`nodal_balance`**

```math

```

=== "PyPSA"

    The model-building half of `examples/ports/references/pypsa/pypsa_fixed.py`:

    ```python
    def build(tables: dict[str, pd.DataFrame]) -> pypsa.Network:
        """The port's tables as a PyPSA network, column for column.

        ``tables`` is the same mapping the lpspec call attaches as ``sources``.

        Both fixings arrive as short frames and are widened to the shape PyPSA
        reads, with ``NaN`` where the port simply has no row: ``p_nom_set``
        reindexed onto the generator index, ``p_set`` pivoted to snapshots by names.
        NaN is PyPSA's own spelling for *not fixed here* — it is what its mask
        tests — so the widening is the translation, not a defaulting choice.

        Every generator is extendable, because ``p_nom_set`` fixes the capacity
        *variable*: a non-extendable component has none for the equality to bind.
        """
        n = pypsa.Network()
        n.set_snapshots(tables['snapshot']['snapshot'])
        n.add('Bus', tables['bus']['bus'])

        generators: pd.DataFrame = tables['generator'].set_index('generator')
        p_set = (
            tables['p_set']
            .pivot(index='snapshot', columns='generator', values='value')
            .reindex(index=n.snapshots, columns=generators.index)
        )

            p_nom_set=tables['p_nom_set'].set_index('generator')['value'].reindex(generators.index, fill_value=np.nan),

    ```

**Two partial tables, at different ranks.** `p_set` is sparse over *(snapshot,
generator)* — two rows, both `chp` — and `p_nom_set` over *(generator)* alone.
The mask is the entire feature, so a model that pinned everything would prove
nothing. Both constraints carry `where:` naming the parameter, which is the
language's spelling for *the rows this table has*; PyPSA spells the same thing
as `NaN` in a widened frame and tests `~isnull()`.

**The capacity fixing needs a capacity variable.** Every generator here is
extendable, including the two whose capacity is pinned. A non-extendable
component has no variable for the equality to bind, so `p_nom_set` would be
silently ignored — which is why the port declares `p_nom` over every generator
and lets the data decide which of them are still a decision.

## What it exercises

`where:` on an equality, at two ranks, against a partial table on the *constant*
side — the case the language refuses to guess at, since a missing row read as
zero would pin the variable to zero rather than leave it free.

## A note on the instance

`gas` carries a `p_nom_max` of 200 it never approaches. An earlier draft capped
it at 60, exactly the capacity it builds, and that coincidence made the problem
dual-degenerate: with the build limit active at the same snapshot as the
capacity limit, `80` and `90` are both optimal nodal prices, and the two
implementations picked differently. The objective agreed throughout. Lifting the
limit off the optimum makes the dual unique, which is what a recorded dual
vector needs to be worth asserting.
