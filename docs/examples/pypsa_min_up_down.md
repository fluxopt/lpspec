# PyPSA minimum up and down times — the rows that make commitment bite

A unit that has started must stay on; one that has stopped must stay off.

> **✔ Verified against pypsa 1.2.4 (its own linopy 0.9.0)** — objective **32750.0**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

[Unit commitment](pypsa_unit_commitment.md) takes the status and the two
transition variables and stops there. On its own that lets a unit start and stop
in consecutive snapshots, paying the charges and doing as it likes. The windows
are what make commitment a scheduling problem: over any `min_up_time`
consecutive snapshots a unit may have started at most as often as it is now
running, and the mirror holds for stopping.

Each window's length is a property of the **generator**, not of the model — 3, 2
and 1 here — because a single shared length would be satisfied by an operator
that ignored the parameter and used a constant.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

PyPSA minimum up and down times: a unit that has started must stay on, and one that has stopped must stay off. Each window is a backward-looking sum whose length is a property of the generator, and the three units here carry different lengths. Optimum 32750.0, from PyPSA itself.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathcal{T}`$ | index $`t`$ — `snapshot` (`int` coordinates) — dispatch periods |
| $`\mathcal{G}`$ | index $`g`$ — `generator` — generating units, each either committed or off |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}`$ | `p_nom` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — installed capacity of a generator |
| $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{min,pu}}`$ | `p_min_pu` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — share of capacity a committed unit must produce at least |
| $`\mathrm{marginal\_cost}`$ | `marginal_cost` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — cost of one unit of output |
| $`\mathrm{start\_up\_cost}`$ | `start_up_cost` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — what bringing a unit up costs, once per start |
| $`\mathrm{shut\_down\_cost}`$ | `shut_down_cost` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — what taking a unit down costs, once per stop |
| $`\mathrm{min\_up\_time}`$ | `min_up_time` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — how many snapshots a unit must stay on once it has started |
| $`\mathrm{min\_down\_time}`$ | `min_down_time` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — how many snapshots a unit must stay off once it has stopped |
| $`\mathrm{load}`$ | `load` over $`\mathcal{T}`$ — demand to be met |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`p`$ | `p` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — output of a generator in a snapshot |
| $`\mathit{status}`$ | `status` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — is this unit committed in this snapshot? |
| $`\mathit{start\_up}`$ | `start_up` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — does this unit come up entering this snapshot? |
| $`\mathit{shut\_down}`$ | `shut_down` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — does this unit go down entering this snapshot? |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}`$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $`p`$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

$`t \boxminus_{v} k`$ denotes translation with $`v`$ standing where index $`t-k`$ leaves the dimension (`shift(edge=v)`), so the row at that boundary is built and carries $`v`$ rather than being dropped.

#### Objective

\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{marginal\_cost}_{g} + \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}} \mathit{start\_up}_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{start\_up\_cost}_{g} + \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}} \mathit{shut\_down}_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{shut\_down\_cost}_{g}

    The model-building half of `examples/ports/references/pypsa/pypsa_min_up_down.py`:

    def build(tables: dict[str, pd.DataFrame]) -> pypsa.Network:
        """The port's tables as a PyPSA network, column for column.

        ``tables`` is the same mapping the lpspec call attaches as ``sources``.

        One bus and no network: a model that fails to match should implicate one
        feature, and here it is the window length. ``committable`` is what turns the
        status into a variable at all, and the two ``*_time_before`` values are set
        rather than defaulted for the reason in the module docstring.
        """
        n = pypsa.Network()
        n.set_snapshots(tables['snapshot']['snapshot'])
        n.add('Bus', 'hub')

        generators: pd.DataFrame = tables['generator'].set_index('generator')
        n.add(
            'Generator',
            generators.index,
            bus='hub',

            down_time_before=0,

            marginal_cost=tables['marginal_cost'].set_index('generator')['value'],

        return n
    ```

**The windows bind, and the schedule shows where.** `mid` runs, drops out over
snapshots 4 and 5, and comes back at 6 — and then has to stay on through 7 even
though the load there is met more cheaply without it. Set every window to 1 and
the same instance solves at **31800.0**, with `mid` free to cycle in and out of
every trough. The 950 between the two numbers is the whole point.

**`sum_back` truncates at the start of the axis, and so does PyPSA.** At snapshot
1 with a window of 3, the sum has two terms rather than three — there is no
snapshot −1 to reach for. Both implementations shorten the window rather than
wrapping or dropping the row, which is why no `edge=` argument appears here.

**The initial conditions are switched off rather than defaulted.**
`up_time_before` defaults to 1 in PyPSA — the unit was already running — which
emits a further block pinning the status on for the remainder of its minimum up
time. That is real behaviour and a *second* feature; this model is about the
windows, so both `*_time_before` values are set to 0. Every unit therefore
begins the horizon **off**, and the first snapshot's transition rows are the
mirror of the ones [unit commitment](pypsa_unit_commitment.md) ports: a unit
committed in the first snapshot pays for a start, and nothing is charged for a
stop, where a unit that began the horizon running pays for no start and is
charged if it goes down.

## What it exercises

`sum_back(x, over=dim, within=p)` with `p` an integer parameter — the
per-entity window length, against a variable, inside a MILP. The `dtype: int`
declaration is required and load-time validation says so by name: *a width
counts positions rather than measuring a distance.*
