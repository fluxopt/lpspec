# PyPSA transmission losses — a quadratic curve, held up by its own tangents

The loss on a line is `r · s²`. PyPSA approximates it from below with a fan of tangents.

> **✔ Verified against pypsa 1.2.4 (its own linopy 0.9.0)** — objective **24114.237385131008**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

For each segment *k* PyPSA takes the point `p_k = k/segments · s_nom`, draws the
tangent to the loss curve there, and adds it once for each sign of the flow.
Every one is a half-plane on `(loss, s)`, so the whole approximation is linear
rows and **no auxiliary variable at all** — the objective pushes the loss down,
the tangents hold it up, and it settles on the curve.

Six snapshots, three busy and three quiet: the flows have to reach the **early**
segments of the fan as well as the top of it. With the busy snapshots alone only
two of five half-planes ever bound, and the other three coefficients could have
been anything without the port noticing.

The network is a path, `b0—b1—b2—b3`, radial on purpose: with no independent
cycle there is no voltage law to satisfy, so a mismatch here implicates the loss
approximation rather than the technique of [Kirchhoff's voltage law](pypsa_kvl.md). The last line has
**no resistance** — PyPSA gives every passive branch a loss variable and lets
`r = 0` pin it to nothing, while the port declares one only where there is a
curve to approximate.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

PyPSA transmission losses, tangent form: the quadratic loss on a line, underestimated from below by a fan of tangent half-planes and subtracted half at each end. No auxiliary variable and no piecewise construct — a tangent is one linear row per segment and per sign of the flow. Optimum 3692.705905599654, from PyPSA itself.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathcal{T}$ | index $t$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $\mathcal{B}$ | index $b$ — `bus` — network nodes |
| $\mathcal{G}$ | index $g$ — `generator` with $\mathrm{gen\_bus}: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{B}$ — generating units, each sitting on one bus |
| $\mathcal{L}$ | index $l$ — `line` with $\mathrm{from}: \mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{B},\enspace \mathrm{to}: \mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{B}$ — passive branches, each joining two buses |
| $\mathcal{S}$ | index $s$ — `segment` — the tangent points the loss curve is approximated at |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}$ | `p_nom` over $\mathcal{G}$ — installed capacity of a generator |
| $\mathrm{marginal\_cost}$ | `marginal_cost` over $\mathcal{G}$ — cost of one unit of output |
| $\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{nom}}$ | `s_nom` over $\mathcal{L}$ — most a line may carry towards its `to` bus |
| $\mathrm{neg\_s\_nom}$ | `neg_s_nom` over $\mathcal{L}$ — most a line may carry the other way, negative by convention |
| $\mathrm{loss}^{\mathrm{max}}$ | `loss_max` over $\mathcal{L}$ — the loss at a line's rating — the top of the curve being approximated, carried as a column because a bound takes a name or a number, and given only for the lines that dissipate anything |
| $\mathrm{loss}^{\mathrm{slope}}$ | `loss_slope` over $\mathcal{L} \times \mathcal{S}$ — the slope of this segment's half-plane — how much loss the flow buys along it. Where the segments come from is the instance's business, not the model's: a tangent to the loss curve and a secant across it both arrive here as a slope and an offset. |
| $\mathrm{loss}^{\mathrm{offset}}$ | `loss_offset` over $\mathcal{L} \times \mathcal{S}$ — where this segment's half-plane meets the loss axis, negative for a curve through the origin |
| $\mathrm{load}$ | `load` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{B}$ — demand at each bus in each snapshot |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $p$ | `p` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}$ — output of a generator in a snapshot |
| $f$ | `f` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{L}$ — flow on a line, signed towards its `to` bus — unbounded here, because the rating covers the flow *and* its loss and so is a row rather than a bound |
| $\mathit{loss}$ | `loss` over $\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{L}$ — the energy a line dissipates carrying its flow — pushed down by the objective and held up by the tangents, so it settles on the approximated curve rather than needing an equality of its own. A line with no resistance dissipates nothing, which is a loss of zero rather than a quantity with no value, so the balances and ratings that name it keep their rows. |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $p$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

        ``tables`` is the same mapping the lpspec call attaches as ``sources``.

        PyPSA is given ``r``, ``x`` and ``s_nom`` and derives the tangents itself.
        The port is given the tangents, because a slope of ``2 * r * p_k`` is
        arithmetic and the language's coefficients take a name or a number — the
        same reason ``pypsa_storage`` ships ``soc_max`` rather than a ratio. Both
        sides therefore describe one model from the same instance, and
        ``SEGMENTS`` is the one number that has to agree between them.
        """
        n = pypsa.Network()
        n.set_snapshots(tables['snapshot']['snapshot'])

    ```

**The rating covers the flow *and* its loss.** This is the one row that is not
obvious from the formulation, and getting it wrong is invisible in two snapshots
out of three: with losses enabled PyPSA replaces the flow bound `|s| ≤ s_nom`
with `s + loss ≤ s_nom` and `s − loss ≥ −s_nom`. So the loss eats into the
capacity rather than riding on top of it, and the flow limit stops being a bound
and becomes a row. A first draft of this port kept the bound, matched PyPSA
exactly at snapshots 0 and 2, and pushed the flow to a full 120 at snapshot 1
where PyPSA stops at 115.97 — 115.97 + 4.03 being exactly 120.

**Losses put a gradient in the prices.** Between `b0` and `b2` the recorded duals
climb `10.00 → 85.78 → 90.00`: power is worth more the further it has to travel,
which is the entire point of modelling losses and something no objective figure
shows. Across the **lossless** line the price does not move at all — `b3` differs
from `b2` only because the local generator sets it.

**The mask needs `absence: zero`, and the instance proves it.** `loss` is
declared `where: loss_max`, so the resistanceless line has no loss variable. But
`loss` also appears as a bare term in the rating rows — `f + loss <= s_nom` —
and a constraint naming a masked variable loses its **row**. Without
`absence: zero` those two rows vanish for that line, it becomes uncapacitated,
and the model reports a cheaper answer with nothing flagged:

| spelling | rows | `omissions` | objective |
|---|---|---|---|
| `where:` + `absence: zero` | 132 | 0 | **24114.24** ✔ |
| `where:` alone | 120 | **2** | 17514.24 ✘ |

Twenty-seven per cent low, and an optimal status — but no longer silent: since
[#944](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/issues/944) a row a propagated absence
deleted is counted, so `diagnostics().omissions` names the two rating rows that
went. The wrong model announces itself where it used to shrug.

**`r` is 0.0003, not a per-unit textbook figure.** PyPSA's loss term is
`r_pu_eff · s²` with `s` in MW, so a resistance chosen for a per-unit base makes
the loss exceed the flow — at `r = 0.05` this instance is *infeasible*, the
generators unable to cover a loss larger than the demand. At this value losses
run about 3% of throughput.

**PyPSA's *other* loss mode is this same model.** Its default is secants rather
than tangents — secants lie above a convex curve where tangents lie below, so
they overestimate the losses these underestimate — and it emits the identical
rows: one half-plane per segment per sign of the flow. Only the coefficients
differ, and how many of them there are.

So it gets no model file of its own. `test_the_two_loss_approximations_are_one_model`
binds *this* model to those coefficients and reaches PyPSA's own secant optimum,
which is the stronger claim: the two approximations are one thing the language
says once.

That is also why the model's parameters are called `loss_slope` and
`loss_offset` rather than anything with *tangent* in it, and why the
coefficients are **dumped** from PyPSA rather than recomputed here. Where the
breakpoints fall is the instance's business — a secant's come out of an error
tolerance, and even their number does — and the model asks only for a slope and
an offset per segment.

## What it exercises

A third dimension that exists only to index an approximation — `segment` is not
a thing in the network, it is a row multiplier — and a variable pinned between
an objective pushing down and a fan of constraints pushing up, with no equality
defining it anywhere.

The tangent slopes and offsets ship as data. `2 · r · p_k` is arithmetic, and a
coefficient here takes a name or a number, the same reason
[storage units](pypsa_storage.md) ships `soc_max` rather than a ratio. That is the
ergonomics case for a method deriving the fan from the curve: two columns and a
segment count instead of six precomputed rows. What it is **not** is a
capability gap — this port needs no construct the language lacks.

[`method: lp`](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/language/piecewise/#lp-the-one-that-declares-nothing)
emits rows of exactly this shape — one linear row per piece, no auxiliary
variable — but it is **not** a drop-in here, and the difference is the whole
approximation. It states the lines through consecutive breakpoints, which for a
convex curve lie *above* it; PyPSA's tangents lie *below*. The two bracket
`r · s²` from opposite sides, so swapping one for the other moves the optimum
rather than restating it, and this port keeps the fan PyPSA publishes.
