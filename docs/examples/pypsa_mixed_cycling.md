# pypsa_mixed_cycling

PyPSA's `cyclic_state_of_charge` is a per-unit flag, so one network runs both
regimes at once: a unit that must end each horizon where it began, beside one
handed a level it may simply spend.

## The problem

[Storage units](pypsa_storage.md) seeds every storage from
`state_of_charge_initial`; [cyclic storage](pypsa_cyclic_storage.md) closes
every storage on itself. A real PyPSA model has both in the same
`StorageUnit` frame, because the flag is a column:

```python
n.add('StorageUnit', ..., cyclic_state_of_charge=[True, False])
```

The two regimes are **one rule and a different predecessor**. A cyclic unit's
first snapshot carries from its last; a seeded unit's carries from a level in the
data. Here that is three blocks under complementary masks, and the masks are the
flag itself:

| Block | Where | What carries into the first snapshot |
|---|---|---|
| `energy_balance_cyclic` | `cyclic` | the unit's own last snapshot (`edge='wrap'`) |
| `energy_balance_carry` | `NOT cyclic` | nothing — the vacated position is absent, so no row is built there |
| `energy_balance_seed` | `NOT cyclic AND position(snapshot) == 0` | `soc_initial` |

`NOT` is a real complement over a boolean column, so every unit falls in exactly
one regime — including one whose flag row is missing, which reads as not cyclic.
The row `energy_balance_carry` does not build at each seeded unit's first
snapshot is reported: `diagnostics().omissions` gives 1, and
`energy_balance_seed` writes it instead.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

PyPSA's `cyclic_state_of_charge` is a column of the StorageUnit frame, so one network runs both regimes at once: a unit that must end each horizon where it began, beside one handed a level it may simply spend. The two are one rule under complementary masks, and the seeded unit's boundary row is what a cyclic one does not have. Optimum 4800.0, from PyPSA itself.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathcal{T}`$ | index $`t`$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $`\mathcal{B}`$ | index $`b`$ — `bus` with $`\mathrm{gen\_bus}: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{B},\ \mathrm{storage\_bus}: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{B}`$ — network nodes |
| $`\mathcal{G}`$ | index $`g`$ — `generator` with $`\mathrm{gen\_bus}: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{B}`$ — generating units, each sitting on one bus |
| $`\mathcal{S}`$ | index $`s`$ — `storage` with $`\mathrm{storage\_bus}: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{B}`$ — storage units, each sitting on one bus |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathrm{cyclic}`$ | `cyclic` over $`\mathcal{S}`$ — whether a unit closes its own horizon. PyPSA's flag, and the one column that decides which of the two balance rules a unit obeys |
| $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}`$ | `p_nom` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — installed capacity of a generator |
| $`\mathrm{marginal\_cost}`$ | `marginal_cost` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — cost of one unit of generation |
| $`\mathrm{storage\_p\_nom}`$ | `storage_p_nom` over $`\mathcal{S}`$ — how fast a storage unit may charge or discharge |
| $`\mathrm{soc}^{\mathrm{max}}`$ | `soc_max` over $`\mathcal{S}`$ — most energy a storage unit may hold |
| $`\mathrm{soc}^{\mathrm{initial}}`$ | `soc_initial` over $`\mathcal{S}`$ — the level a seeded unit begins with. A cyclic unit has one in the data and never reads it — its own last snapshot is its opening level |
| $`\mathrm{load}`$ | `load` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{B}`$ — demand to be met at a bus |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`p`$ | `p` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — output of a generator in a snapshot |
| $`p^{\mathrm{dispatch}}`$ | `p_dispatch` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{S}`$ — power a storage unit puts onto its bus |
| $`p^{\mathrm{store}}`$ | `p_store` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{S}`$ — power a storage unit takes off its bus |
| $`\mathit{soc}`$ | `soc` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{S}`$ — energy in the store at the end of a snapshot |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $`\mathrm{cyclic}`$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $`p`$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

$`t \ominus k`$ denotes cyclic translation: index $`t-k`$ taken modulo the size of the dimension (`roll`). Plain $`t-k`$ (`shift`) has no wraparound — terms translated past the edge are simply absent.

$`\mathrm{pos}(t)`$ denotes where index $`t`$ sits along its dimension's own order — the order `shift` walks, not the order labels sort in — counted from $`0`$. The index itself stays the coordinate, so $`t`$ compares against labels and $`\mathrm{pos}(t)`$ against positions.

## Both flags bind

Neither regime is decoration on this instance — flipping either changes the
answer, in opposite directions:

| Instance | Objective |
|---|---|
| as shipped — `ring` cyclic, `seasonal` seeded | **4800.0** |
| `ring` flipped to seeded | 4400.0 |
| `seasonal` flipped to cyclic | 7200.0 |

`ring` carries a `soc_initial` of 20 that it never reads, which is the point of
the first row: a cyclic unit ignores the level in the data, and flipping its flag
hands it 400 of free energy. `seasonal`'s 30 is worth 2400, because a cyclic unit
must give back everything it spends.

## What the answer looks like

```text
snapshot  price   ring   seasonal
0         20      15     30      ← seasonal opens at its given level; ring opens where it will close
1         80      0      15      ← both discharge into the peak
2         20      10     15
3         20      0      0       ← ring is back where it started; seasonal need not be
```

The price is the dual of `nodal_balance`: 20 where the base plant is marginal
and 80 at the snapshot where the peaker runs, which is what makes moving energy
worth anything at all.

## What this model is for

It is the shape neither storage model has. The two differ by one deleted
`where`, and each is uniform — so nothing in the corpus exercised *a data column
choosing between two boundary regimes* until this one. The finding is that it
needs no language feature: three blocks, complementary masks, and the dropped row
visible in `omissions`.
