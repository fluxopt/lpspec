# PyPSA LOPF — Kirchhoff's voltage law

Passive AC lines: flow is decided by physics, not chosen.

> **✔ Verified against pypsa 1.2.4 (its own linopy 0.9.0)** — objective **17000**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`, nodal prices and line flows included.

Every model above moves power over `Link` objects, whose flow is a decision
variable — a transport model. A `Line` is passive: around every independent
cycle of the network, the reactance-weighted flows must sum to zero.

It builds on [the transport model](pypsa_transport.md) rather than on
[cyclic storage](pypsa_cyclic_storage.md), and that is deliberate. Ramps,
storage and a closed horizon are
**time**-coupling — ramps, state of charge, a closed horizon. This one is
**space**-coupling. The two axes are independent, so stacking them would only
make a mismatch ambiguous about which caused it.

Three buses in a triangle, so the cycle space has exactly one dimension. The
flows come out fractional — 46.67 / 26.67 / −33.33 at the first snapshot —
because the split is forced by reactance rather than chosen by cost, which is
the whole difference between a line and a link.

PyPSA linear optimal power flow over passive AC lines under Kirchhoff's voltage law, rather than links whose flow is chosen. Optimum 17000.0, from PyPSA itself.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathcal{T}`$ | index $`t`$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $`\mathcal{B}`$ | index $`b`$ — `bus` with $`\mathrm{gen\_bus}: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{B},\ \mathrm{line\_from}: \mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{B},\ \mathrm{line\_to}: \mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{B}`$ — network nodes |
| $`\mathcal{G}`$ | index $`g`$ — `generator` with $`\mathrm{gen\_bus}: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{B}`$ — generating units, each sitting on one bus |
| $`\mathcal{L}`$ | index $`l`$ — `line` with $`\mathrm{line\_from}: \mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{B},\ \mathrm{line\_to}: \mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{B}`$ — passive AC lines, each joining two buses |
| $`\mathcal{C}`$ | index $`c`$ — `cycle` — one independent loop of the network |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}`$ | `p_nom` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — installed capacity of a generator |
| $`\mathrm{marginal\_cost}`$ | `marginal_cost` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — cost of one unit of output |
| $`\mathrm{s}^{\mathrm{nom}}`$ | `s_nom` over $`\mathcal{L}`$ — most a line may carry towards its `line_to` bus |
| $`\mathrm{neg\_s\_nom}`$ | `neg_s_nom` over $`\mathcal{L}`$ — most a line may carry the other way, negative by convention |
| $`\mathrm{cycle\_incidence}`$ | `cycle_incidence` over $`\mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{L}`$ — the cycle basis, as a sparse table of reactance times direction — a line may belong to several cycles, so this is a parameter over both dimensions rather than a coordinate, and rows are absent where a line is in no cycle |
| $`\mathrm{load}`$ | `load` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{B}`$ — demand at each bus in each snapshot |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`p`$ | `p` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — output of a generator in a snapshot |
| $`f`$ | `f` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{L}`$ — flow on a line, signed towards its `line_to` bus — not chosen, but whatever the voltage law leaves |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}`$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $`p`$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

#### Objective

```math
\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{marginal\_cost}_{g}
```

#### Subject to

**`nodal_balance`**

```

**`kirchhoff_voltage_law`**

```math
\sum_{l \in \mathcal{L}} f_{t,l} \cdot \mathrm{cycle\_incidence}_{c,l} = 0 \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ c \in \mathcal{C}
```

#### Variable domains

**The cycle basis is a parameter, not a coordinate.** This is the one shape
decision worth reading twice. A line may belong to *several* cycles, and a
declared coordinate is single-valued per label — so `cycle_incidence` is a
parameter over `(cycle, line)` carrying reactance × direction, with rows simply
absent where a line is not in a cycle. Row absence is how this language spells
sparsity everywhere else, and a cycle-line incidence matrix is exactly the
sparse thing it is good at.

That makes the constraint one equation, `sum(f * cycle_incidence, over=line) ==
0`, rather than a case analysis over the topology — and it keeps
[topology as data](pypsa_transport.md): a fourth bus is more rows, not a
different file.

**Computing the basis is data preparation, and stays outside the language.**
Finding a cycle basis is a graph algorithm — iteration over a structure
discovered from data, which the
[ceiling](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/ceiling/#two-tiers-and-the-ceiling) refuses by design. The
reference prints the rows PyPSA derived so the two can be checked against each
other. They need only agree on the *cycle space*: PyPSA scales its coefficients
for conditioning, and since the row is `= 0`, any nonzero multiple of a cycle
says the same thing.

## What it exercises

A parameter over two dimensions multiplying a variable over one, reduced along
the shared dimension — the shape that makes an incidence matrix sayable at all.
Plus `sum(by=)` on both line endpoints for the nodal balance, as in the transport model.

Kirchhoff's voltage law needed no new construct, which is the result worth
reporting.
