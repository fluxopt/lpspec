# sos

A piecewise-linear cost curve stated as a **special-ordered set** —
[piecewise](piecewise.md) with one line changed, handed to the solver as a set
it branches on itself.

## The problem

A convex-combination curve needs one thing said about its weights: at most two
may be nonzero, and they must be **neighbours**. Otherwise the weights mix
distant breakpoints and the model prices the chord under the curve instead of
the curve:

$$p = \sum_k \lambda_k x_k, \quad
\mathrm{cost} = \sum_k \lambda_k y_k, \quad
\sum_k \lambda_k = 1, \quad
\lambda \in \mathrm{SOS2}$$

There are two ways to say the last line, and `method:` names them.
`adjacency`, the default, *builds* it: a binary per segment, an adjacency row
per breakpoint, and one more row picking a segment. `sos2` *declares* it: the
expansion emits an [`sos:` block](https://math-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/language/piecewise/#sos) over
the same weights and leaves the
formulation to the sink — which is the point, because a solver that knows what
SOS2 means branches on the set directly rather than searching the binaries
someone wrote for it. The raw `sos:` block stays in the language for a set
that is not a curve — pick at most one of these build sizes, say — where there
is no `piecewise:` declaration to emit it.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

A piecewise-linear cost curve stated as a special-ordered set, so the solver is handed the adjacency restriction rather than binaries that encode it.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathcal{T}`$ | index $`t`$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $`\mathcal{G}`$ | index $`g`$ — `generator` — dispatchable units |
| $`\mathcal{B}`$ | index $`b`$ — `bp` — breakpoints of the cost curve |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{max}}`$ | `p_max` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — maximum dispatch |
| $`\mathrm{load}`$ | `load` over $`\mathcal{T}`$ — demand to be met |
| $`\mathrm{bp\_x}`$ | `bp_x` over $`\mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{B}`$ — breakpoint dispatch levels, one curve per generator |
| $`\mathrm{bp\_y}`$ | `bp_y` over $`\mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{B}`$ — cost at each breakpoint, one curve per generator |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`p`$ | `p` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — dispatched power |
| $`\mathit{op\_cost}`$ | `op_cost` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — operating cost, piecewise-linear in dispatch |
| $`\mathit{cost\_curve\_lam}`$ | `cost_curve_lam` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{B}`$ — convex-combination weight on a breakpoint |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{max}}`$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $`p`$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

#### Objective

```math
\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}} \mathit{op\_cost}_{t,g}
```

#### Subject to

**`balance`**

```math
\sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} = \mathrm{load}_{t} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T}
```

**`cost_curve_convexity`**

```math
\sum_{b \in \mathcal{B}} \mathit{cost\_curve\_lam}_{t,g,b} = 1 \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}
```

**`cost_curve_link0`**

```math
p_{t,g} = \sum_{b \in \mathcal{B}} \mathit{cost\_curve\_lam}_{t,g,b} \cdot \mathrm{bp\_x}_{g,b} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}
```

**`cost_curve_link1`**

```math
\mathit{op\_cost}_{t,g} = \sum_{b \in \mathcal{B}} \mathit{cost\_curve\_lam}_{t,g,b} \cdot \mathrm{bp\_y}_{g,b} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}
```

#### Variable domains

**`p`**

```math
0 \le p_{t,g} \le \mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{max}}_{g} \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}
```

**`op_cost`**

```math
\mathit{op\_cost}_{t,g} \ge 0 \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}
```

**`cost_curve_lam`**

```math
0 \le \mathit{cost\_curve\_lam}_{t,g,b} \le 1 \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G},\ b \in \mathcal{B}
```

**`cost_curve_lam sos`**

```math
\left( \mathit{cost\_curve\_lam}_{t,g,b} \right)_{b \in \mathcal{B}} \in \mathrm{SOS}2 \qquad \forall\, t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}
```

## What it exercises

`method: sos2` expands into the same weights, convexity row and link rows as
the default — plus a set instead of the segment binaries. That set is the one
declaration that adds neither a column nor a row: it names columns the
expansion already made and says which of them may be nonzero together, so it
leaves the engine as a **fifth stream** beside `cols`, `obj`, `rows` and the
matrix.

That stream is also the one a sink may not be able to take, which is what makes
this model worth reading beside `piecewise`:

| | what it does with this model |
|---|---|
| `gurobi`, `xpress` | `addSOS` — branches on the set, no binaries in the model at all |
| `lp_file` | an `sos` section, read by any solver whose parser has one |
| `highs` | **no SOS concept** — the set arrives reformulated, as a binary per segment and a linking row per member |

So the same file runs everywhere, and what differs is the *search*, not the
answer. On HiGHS the reformulation is very nearly what `method: adjacency`
would have emitted, which is the honest summary of what a capability gap costs
here: a worse relaxation, never a refusal. Two conditions come with it — every
member needs a finite upper bound (the emitted weights carry one), and the
result is mixed-integer, so an otherwise-continuous model gives up its duals.

Compare [piecewise](piecewise.md) — the same file to the word, except
`method: convex`. Both expand before the plan exists, and nothing called
*piecewise* survives into it; what differs is what the expansion leaves
behind: a pure LP there, and here a set that is still a set right up to the
sink that takes it.
