# PyPSA unit commitment

Which generators are *on*, not just how much they produce — a binary per generator per snapshot, with start-up and shut-down charges.

> **✔ Verified against pypsa 1.2.4 (its own linopy 0.9.0)** — objective **24900**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

**The corpus's MILP entry.** Every other verified model is a pure continuous
LP; this one carries integrality, which is what the gallery's construct matrix
had no verified example of. One bus and no network, deliberately: a model that
fails to match should implicate one feature, and here that feature is
commitment.

`min_up_time` and `min_down_time` are left at 0 here;
[minimum up and down times](pypsa_min_up_down.md) is the model that writes them.

## The model

<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

PyPSA unit commitment: which generators are on, not just how much they produce — a binary status per generator per snapshot, with start-up and shut-down charges. Optimum 24900.0, from PyPSA itself.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathcal{T}`$ | index $`t`$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $`\mathcal{G}`$ | index $`g`$ — `generator` — generating units, each either committed or off |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}`$ | `p_nom` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — installed capacity of a generator |
| $`\mathrm{marginal\_cost}`$ | `marginal_cost` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — cost of one unit of output |
| $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{min,pu}}`$ | `p_min_pu` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — share of capacity a committed unit must produce at least |
| $`\mathrm{start\_up\_cost}`$ | `start_up_cost` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — what bringing a unit up costs, once per start |
| $`\mathrm{shut\_down\_cost}`$ | `shut_down_cost` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — what taking a unit down costs, once per stop |
| $`\mathrm{load}`$ | `load` over $`\mathcal{T}`$ — demand to be met |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`p`$ | `p` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — output of a generator in a snapshot |
| $`\mathit{status}`$ | `status` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — is this unit committed in this snapshot? |
| $`\mathit{start\_up}`$ | `start_up` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — does this unit come up entering this snapshot? |
| $`\mathit{shut\_down}`$ | `shut_down` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — does this unit go down entering this snapshot? |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}`$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $`p`$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

$`\mathrm{pos}(t)`$ denotes where index $`t`$ sits along its dimension's own order — the order `shift` walks, not the order labels sort in — counted from $`0`$. The index itself stays the coordinate, so $`t`$ compares against labels and $`\mathrm{pos}(t)`$ against positions.

#### Objective

```math
\min \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}} p_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{marginal\_cost}_{g} + \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}} \mathit{start\_up}_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{start\_up\_cost}_{g} + \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T},\ g \in \mathcal{G}} \mathit{shut\_down}_{t,g} \cdot \mathrm{shut\_down\_cost}_{g}

=== "PyPSA"

    The model-building half of `examples/ports/references/pypsa/pypsa_unit_commitment.py`:

    ```python
    def build(tables: dict[str, pd.DataFrame]) -> pypsa.Network:
        """The port's tables as a PyPSA network, column for column.

        ``tables`` is the same mapping the lpspec call attaches as ``sources``.
        """
        n = pypsa.Network()
        n.set_snapshots(tables['snapshot']['snapshot'])
        n.add('Bus', 'bus')

        generators: pd.DataFrame = tables['generator'].set_index('generator')

        n.add(
            'Generator',
            generators.index,
            bus='bus',
            committable=True,
            p_nom=tables['p_nom'].set_index('generator')['value'],
            marginal_cost=tables['marginal_cost'].set_index('generator')['value'],
            p_min_pu=tables['p_min_pu'].set_index('generator')['value'],
            start_up_cost=tables['start_up_cost'].set_index('generator')['value'],
            shut_down_cost=tables['shut_down_cost'].set_index('generator')['value'],
        )

        load: pd.Series = tables['load'].set_index('snapshot')['value']
        n.add('Load', 'load', bus='bus', p_set=load)
        return n
    ```

**The first snapshot is not like the others.** PyPSA's default is that a unit
was already up before the horizon began, so the start-up row is slackened to
`>= -1` there and never binds, while the shut-down row still charges a unit
that begins the horizon *off*. `peak` does, so the instance pays a shut-down it
never visibly performs. That asymmetry is PyPSA's, it is worth 50 here, and
reproducing it is most of what makes this a fidelity test rather than a
plausible-looking rewrite.

Two `where` clauses on one constraint block is how the language says "this row
differs at the boundary" — the same shape [storage](storage.md) uses for its
initial state of charge.

## What it costs

| | |
|---|---|
| energy | `30 × 520 + 90 × 100` = 24600 |
| start-ups | `peak` at snapshot 1 = 200 |
| shut-downs | `peak` at snapshot 0 (begins off) and at 3 = 100 |
| **total** | **24900** |

`base` runs throughout; `peak` covers the two peak snapshots. lpspec and PyPSA
agree on the schedule as well as the cost.

## What it exercises

`binary` variables and the integrality path through to HiGHS, `shift` across a
boundary condition, and a three-term objective mixing an energy cost with two
transition charges.
