# monthly_budget

A cap on what each technology may generate per calendar month — an aggregate
over a *coarser grouping of time*, written with the same operator that places
a generator on a bus.

> **✔ Agrees with hand-written linopy 0.9.0** — objective **9500**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

## The problem

$$\sum_{t \thinspace:\thinspace \mathrm{month}(t) = m} p_{t,g} \quad\le\quad \bar E_{m,g}$$

$\mathrm{month}$ is a **coordinate the snapshot dimension declares**, not a
calendar the language understands. Its values arrive as a column in the
snapshot index, so the same model expresses weeks, seasons, fiscal quarters,
peak/off-peak blocks or representative days by changing that one column and
nothing else.

Compare [transport](transport.md): there, $\mathrm{gen\_bus}$ is a lookup over
`generator` and the sum is over generators at a bus. Here $\mathrm{month\_of}$ is a
lookup over `snapshot` and the sum is over snapshots in a month. **It is the
same construct** — `sum(by=)` — and time is not a special axis.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

A cap on what each technology may generate per calendar month — an aggregate over a coarser grouping of time than the model is dispatched on.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathcal{T}`$ | index $`t`$ — `snapshot` with $`\mathrm{month\_of}: \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{M}`$ — dispatch periods, each falling in one month |
| $`\mathcal{M}`$ | index $`m`$ — `month` with $`\mathrm{month\_of}: \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{M}`$ — the grouping the budget is stated over |
| $`\mathcal{G}`$ | index $`g`$ — `generator` — generating units |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\bar p`$ | `p_max` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — installed capacity |
| $`c`$ | `cost` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — marginal cost |
| $`\ell`$ | `load` over $`\mathcal{T}`$ — demand to be met |
| $`\bar E`$ | `monthly_cap` over $`\mathcal{M} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — the budget the group sum is checked against, one per month and technology |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|

=== "linopy"

    The model-building half of `examples/ports/references/linopy/monthly_budget.py`:

    ```python
    def build(tables: dict[str, pd.DataFrame]) -> linopy.Model:
        """The instance's tables as a linopy model, row for row.

        ``tables`` is the same mapping the lpspec call attaches as ``sources``.
        """
        p_max: pd.Series = tables['p_max'].set_index('generator')['value']
        cost: pd.Series = tables['cost'].set_index('generator')['value']
        load: pd.Series = tables['load'].set_index('snapshot')['value']
        cap = xr.DataArray(tables['monthly_cap'].pivot(index='month', columns='generator', values='value'))
        month = xr.DataArray(tables['month_of'].set_index('snapshot')['month'])

        m = linopy.Model()
        p = m.add_variables(lower=0, upper=p_max, coords=[load.index, p_max.index], name='p')
        m.add_constraints(p.sum('generator') == load, name='balance')
        m.add_constraints(p.groupby(month).sum() <= cap, name='monthly_budget')
        m.add_objective((p * cost).sum())
        return m
    ```

## The grouping is data

The `month_of` map is produced before the model, by whatever rule you want:

```python
month_of = pl.DataFrame({'snapshot': hours}).with_columns(pl.col('snapshot').dt.strftime('%Y-%m').alias('month'))
```

What that produces is the relation the model binds under `month_of` — every
snapshot beside the month it falls in, and nothing else:

```text
shape: (6, 2)
┌─────────────────────┬─────────┐
│ snapshot            ┆ month   │
│ ---                 ┆ ---     │
│ datetime[μs]        ┆ str     │
╞═════════════════════╪═════════╡
│ 2030-01-01 00:00:00 ┆ 2030-01 │

└─────────────────────┴─────────┘
```

Three snapshots in January, one in February, two in March: `sum(by=)` needs a
partition, not equal groups.

That one expression is the only place a calendar appears anywhere. Swap it for
`dt.quarter()`, a fiscal-year lookup, or a hand-built table of representative
periods and the model is unchanged — which is why there is no `resample:` or
`reduce_to_monthly()` in the language and never will be. A domain helper would
cover one of those cases; a mapping column covers all of them.

## Reading it back

The budget's dual is a shadow price per month and technology, so a binding cap
says what relaxing it would be worth:

```text
month     generator   dual
2030-01   wind       -49.0   ← binding: displacing gas (50) with wind (1)
2030-02   wind        -0.0
2030-03   wind        -0.0
```

Per-month *results* need no language support at all — a primal is a tidy frame,
so it is a join and a `group_by`:

```python
sol.primal('p').join(index, on='snapshot').group_by('month').agg(pl.col('value').sum())
```

## Why `month` is a dimension

A lookup is a **function between two dimensions**, so it needs a
codomain. `month` being one is not ceremony — three things rest on it:

1. **`sum(by=)` lands terms on the dimension the lookup targets.**
   The expression's dims are therefore `[month, generator]`, and a `foreach:`
   can only name declared dimensions.
2. **`monthly_cap` is indexed *by* month.** A parameter carries values *at*
   coordinates; it cannot be the thing a `foreach` ranges over. So month could
   not be a parameter even if the grouping did not need it.
3. **It is what makes a typo an error.** A value in the snapshot index that is
   not a coordinate of `month` is rejected at attach time:

```text
DataError: dimension 'snapshot' coordinate 'month' has value(s) that are
           not 'month' coordinates: '2030-3'
```

That third one is the load-bearing reason. With no declared target there is
nothing to check against, and `2030-3` sitting beside `2030-03` would quietly
become a fourth group with a budget of its own — a smaller problem, solved
without a word. It is the same check that catches a generator assigned to a bus
that does not exist.

**Null is still legal.** A snapshot belonging to no month contributes its terms
nowhere, exactly as a generator on no bus does (the declaration rules). Absent is a claim;
misspelled is a mistake.

## What this cannot do

`sum(by=)` takes a **partition**: `month_of` is a function from snapshot to
month, so a snapshot with a month belongs to exactly one group. Unequal groups
are fine, and a group with no members contributes nothing — as does a snapshot
whose coordinate is null, which belongs to no group and lands nowhere.

What it cannot express is an **overlapping** aggregate — *"trailing twelve
months, at every month"* — because each snapshot would belong to twelve groups
and no single column can say so. That is a sliding window over a variable, and
it is the fixed-width window, [#468](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/issues/468).

The same split shows up one level up, where a *process* loops over plans
rather than an expression looping over rows
([#457](https://github.com/fluxopt/lpspec/issues/457)): slicing a model per
group is a partition, slicing it per window overlaps. Here `sum(by=)`
partitions, and the overlapping counterpart is the piece that has not landed.
