# PyPSA spillage — water a reservoir cannot hold

A hydro unit takes inflow it did not choose, and spills what neither turbine nor reservoir can absorb.

> **✔ Verified against pypsa 1.2.4 (its own linopy 0.9.0)** — objective **3200.0**, matched to `rtol=1e-09`.

`inflow` is energy that arrives whether or not the model wanted it. When the
reservoir is full and the turbine is at its limit, the energy balance can only
close if something lets the surplus go — which is what `spill` is.

Two storage units share the bus: `res` receives inflow, `bat` receives none. The
battery earns its place by absorbing water that would otherwise be spilled, so
neither unit is decoration.

## The model

<!-- math:begin -->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>The same model, as math</summary>

PyPSA storage spillage: water a reservoir cannot hold leaves through a second sink. A hydro unit takes inflow it did not choose and spills what neither its turbine nor its reservoir can absorb; a battery beside it has no inflow, and so no spill variable at all. Optimum 3200.0, from PyPSA itself.

#### Sets

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathcal{T}`$ | index $`t`$ — `snapshot` — dispatch periods |
| $`\mathcal{B}`$ | index $`b`$ — `bus` — network nodes |
| $`\mathcal{G}`$ | index $`g`$ — `generator` with $`\mathrm{gen\_bus}: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{B}`$ — generating units, each sitting on one bus |
| $`\mathcal{S}`$ | index $`s`$ — `storage` with $`\mathrm{storage\_bus}: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{B}`$ — storage units, each sitting on one bus |

#### Parameters

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}`$ | `p_nom` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — installed capacity of a generator |
| $`\mathrm{marginal\_cost}`$ | `marginal_cost` over $`\mathcal{G}`$ — cost of one unit of output |
| $`\mathrm{storage\_p\_nom}`$ | `storage_p_nom` over $`\mathcal{S}`$ — most a storage unit may charge or discharge in one snapshot |
| $`\mathrm{soc}^{\mathrm{max}}`$ | `soc_max` over $`\mathcal{S}`$ — how much energy a storage unit holds when full |
| $`\mathrm{soc}^{\mathrm{initial}}`$ | `soc_initial` over $`\mathcal{S}`$ — energy in the store before the first snapshot |
| $`\mathrm{inflow}`$ | `inflow` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{S}`$ — energy arriving at a storage unit whether or not it was wanted — zero for a unit that receives none |
| $`\mathrm{load}`$ | `load` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{B}`$ — demand at each bus in each snapshot |

#### Variables

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $`p`$ | `p` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{G}`$ — output of a generator in a snapshot |
| $`p^{\mathrm{dispatch}}`$ | `p_dispatch` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{S}`$ — power a storage unit puts onto its bus |
| $`p^{\mathrm{store}}`$ | `p_store` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{S}`$ — power a storage unit takes off its bus |
| $`\mathit{soc}`$ | `soc` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{S}`$ — energy in the store at the end of a snapshot |
| $`\mathit{spill}`$ | `spill` over $`\mathcal{T} \times \mathcal{S}`$ — inflow let go rather than kept, and never more than that snapshot's arrival. A unit that receives no inflow has none to let go, which is a spill of zero rather than a quantity with no value — so the energy balance keeps its row there. |

Upright is what the model is given — a parameter such as $`\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{nom}}`$, a coordinate map, a label — and italic is what the solver chooses, such as $`p`$. An index is italic too, being what a quantifier chooses, and a set is script.

$`\mathrm{pos}(t)`$ denotes where index $`t`$ sits along its dimension's own order — the order `shift` walks, not the order labels sort in — counted from $`0`$. The index itself stays the coordinate, so $`t`$ compares against labels and $`\mathrm{pos}(t)`$ against positions.

        positive somewhere; the port declares it for every unit and bounds it above
        by the inflow, which pins it to zero for the battery. Same model, and the

**Spilling is forced, not chosen.** Snapshot 1 opens with a full 60 MWh
reservoir and 50 MWh more arriving against a 30 MW turbine, so at least 20 MWh
has to go. Total gas burn is then pinned at `20 + spill` = 40 MWh, which is the
entire objective. A port that dropped the spill variable would be **infeasible**
rather than merely wrong — which is a better failure than most.

**The battery has no spill decision at all**, and says so. PyPSA declares the
spill variable only for units whose inflow is positive somewhere; the port
matches that with `where: "inflow != 0"`, which is why `spill` has six
coordinates rather than twelve.

That mask is only safe because of the line beside it. A constraint mentioning a
masked variable loses its **row**, not just the term — so on its own the mask
would delete the battery's whole energy balance, its stored energy would come
from nowhere, and the model would report **0.0** instead of 3200. `absence: zero`
is what says the missing coordinates hold a spill of zero rather than a quantity
with no value, so the row stands and the term simply is not in it.

The alternative is to bound `spill` above by `inflow` and let the zero pin it,
which is what this port did before `absence:` existed. Same answer, six more
columns, and a model that says *this unit's spill is zero* where it means *this
unit does not spill*.

**Why the mask compares rather than naming the parameter.** `where: inflow`
would be a **no-op** here: a `where:` on a bare parameter reads *defined and
finite*, and the padded `0.0` is both. The zeros cannot simply be dropped from
the table either — `inflow` is a term on the energy balance's constant side, and
a sparse parameter there is refused at load, since a missing row read as zero
would be a bound rather than an absence. So the sparsity that matters is in the
*value*, and `!= 0` is how the model asks for it.

## What it exercises

`absence: zero` on a masked variable — the declaration that keeps a row whose
term has gone — against an energy balance carrying two independent sinks. Also
the asymmetry underneath it: a masked **variable** takes its row, while a sparse
**parameter** on a constant side is refused outright, so the two halves of this
model's sparsity are spelled in two different ways.
