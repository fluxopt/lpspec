# Reading a directory of runs

How to read many archives at once: which runs terminated how, what each cost,
and which input changed between them. One archive is
[archiving a solve](archiving.md); this is the directory they pile up in.

## The three tables

An archive is a tree of parquet files, so a directory of them is a table per
glob. Nothing is loaded and no schema is maintained:

```python
import polars as pl

answers = pl.read_parquet('runs/*/answer/record.parquet')
metrics = pl.read_parquet('runs/*/answer/metrics.parquet')
inputs = pl.read_parquet('runs/*/sources.parquet')
```

| glob | one row per | says |
|---|---|---|
| `answer/record.parquet` | solve, or sweep slice | how it terminated, what it reached, when, under what name |
| `answer/metrics.parquet` | the same | what the build and its solves spent, and how big the model was |
| `sources.parquet` | source per archive | what each input's bytes digest to |

**Every row says which archive it came from.** `run` is the archive's own
name: `runs/nightly-2026-09-10.zip` writes `nightly-2026-09-10`. It is on all
three tables, so nothing has to read the paths.

**A directory holding both solves and sweeps does not glob.** A sweep's record
carries the dimension its axis cut on, and its metrics carry different columns
from a solve's. polars refuses the mismatch:

```text
SchemaError: extra column in file outside of expected schema: scenario
```

Union by name instead. The columns one side lacks come back null:

```python
from glob import glob

answers = pl.concat(
    [pl.read_parquet(file) for file in sorted(glob('runs/*/answer/record.parquet'))],
    how='diagonal',
)
```

`sources.parquet` has the same three columns whoever wrote it, so it globs
either way.

**Use `load_archive` and `scan_archive` for one archive, not for many.** They
give back a spec, its sources and an answer, which is what re-running a case
needs. A warehouse question is a query over the parquet.

## The run on a value frame

`answer/primal/p.parquet` holds the model's own dimension columns and `value`.
Nothing in it says which archive it came from, so only the three tables above
answer that.

**Name the directory `run=<name>` and every frame carries the run.** That is
the hive layout. A query engine reads it as a column, and no file stores it:

```python
sps.solve('dispatch.yaml', sources, archive='runs/run=nightly-2026-09-10/')

pl.read_parquet('runs/*/answer/primal/p.parquet', hive_partitioning=True)
# snapshot  generator  value  run
# 0         wind       90.5   nightly-2026-09-10
# 0         solar      0.0    nightly-2026-09-10
```

**The three tables carry the same name.** The archive is named
`nightly-2026-09-10`. The stamp drops the `run=`, so a join on `run` matches
whichever side a column came from.

**A zip cannot use the layout.** No query engine reads inside one, so a
warehouse queried where it lies is a directory of directories.

## Compare cases solved apart

`solved_at` is when the solver returned, so runs solved on different machines
still order:

```python
table = pl.read_parquet('runs/*/answer/record.parquet')
table.sort('solved_at').select('run', 'status', 'objective')
```

**Check the digests before you read the numbers.** `spec_digest` is a digest of
the spec an answer came back from. One distinct value across the table is the
claim that every row answered the same document, and a null is a row that
named none, so ask for both:

```python
assert table['spec_digest'].n_unique() == 1, 'one spec, or this compares nothing'
assert table['spec_digest'].null_count() == 0, 'and every row named the document it answered'
```

## Find which input changed between two runs

`spec_digest` says two runs answered the same document and nothing about the
numbers, so two runs of one spec over different data carry the same one.
`sources.parquet` separates them, and names the input that moved:

```python
import specsolve as sps

base = sps.load_archive('runs/base/')
other = sps.load_archive('runs/halved/')

moved = base.source_digests.join(other.source_digests, on='source', suffix='_other').filter(
    pl.col('digest') != pl.col('digest_other')
)
moved['source'].to_list()  # ['load']
```

**Across a whole directory it is a window rather than a join**, `run` being on
every row:

```python
inputs = pl.read_parquet('runs/*/sources.parquet')
inputs.sort('run').with_columns(before=pl.col('digest').shift().over('source')).filter(
    pl.col('before').is_not_null() & (pl.col('before') != pl.col('digest'))
)
```

**The digest is of the bytes the archive holds**, so hashing
`sources/load.parquet` gives the row back. Two archives of the same data
written by different versions of polars can differ, and reading an archive
does not verify the digests
([the rule](../reference/api.md#specsolve.SolveArchive)).

## See what the runs cost

`answer/metrics.parquet` carries the model's size beside the clocks, so one
query says which cases are growing and where the time goes:

```python
metrics.select('run', 'rows', 'nonzeros', 'build_seconds', 'solve_seconds').sort(
    pl.col('build_seconds') + pl.col('solve_seconds'), descending=True
)
```

The columns are [the metrics](../reference/api.md#specsolve.relational.parquet.Metrics). A sweep
records a `SliceMetrics` per slice instead, keyed by the axis and stamped
with `run` like any other row
([reading a sweep](../reference/sweeps.md#reading-a-sweep)).

## Query it from a database

A directory archive is parquet where it lies, so a query engine reads it
without polars in the way. In DuckDB, `union_by_name` takes the two kinds of
archive together:

```sql
select run, rows, nonzeros, build_seconds, solve_seconds
from read_parquet('runs/*/answer/metrics.parquet', union_by_name = true)
order by build_seconds + solve_seconds desc;
```

**A value frame carries `run` where the directory is named for it.** DuckDB
reads the same hive layout, and the query says nothing about it:

```sql
select run, snapshot, generator, value
from read_parquet('runs/*/answer/primal/p.parquet', hive_partitioning = true)
order by run, snapshot;
```

Inside one archive every frame is tidy, so the values join to the sources they
were solved from on the coordinates both carry:

```sql
select p.snapshot, p.generator, p.value, load.value as load
from 'runs/base/answer/primal/p.parquet' p
join 'runs/base/sources/load.parquet' load using (snapshot);
```

**A zip has to be unpacked first**, because no query engine reads inside one.
Give either reader an `into=` and query what lands there.
