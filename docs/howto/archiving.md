# Archiving a solve

How to keep a solve: the spec, the data it was solved with, and what came
back, so you can read the answer later, ask the question again, or hand both
to someone else. The reference is
[archiving a model](../reference/api.md#archiving-a-model).

## Archive as you solve

```python
import specsolve as sps

sps.solve('dispatch.yaml', sources, archive='case/')
```

That writes `model.yaml`, one `sources/<key>.parquet` per key the file
declares, and `answer/` holding everything the solve produced:

```text
case/
    model.yaml
    sources/cost.parquet
    sources/load.parquet
    …
    sources.parquet               (run, source, digest) — what each of them is
    answer/objective.parquet      how it terminated, what it reached, when, and under what name
    answer/metrics.parquet        what the build and its solves took
    answer/primal/p.parquet       one file per variable
    answer/dual/power_balance.parquet
```

**The suffix picks the container.** Anything without a `.zip` suffix is a
directory, as above. `.zip` packs the same members into one file:

```python
sps.solve('dispatch.yaml', sources, archive='case.zip')
```

**`sps.solve`, `model.solve` and `sps.solve_over` take `archive=`.** Nothing
else writes one.

## Read it back

```python
case = sps.load_archive('case/')

case.answer.objective  # what it reached
case.answer.primal('p')  # the values it came back with
sps.solve(case.spec, case.sources)  # the same question, asked again
```

**`load_archive` reads it whole.** The sources come back as tables, the
answer's frames are in memory, and nothing has to be kept alive afterwards. A
zip unpacks to a scratch directory that is gone when the call returns:

```python
case = sps.load_archive('case.zip')
```

Pass `into=` when you want the extracted tree as well, to query it with an
engine that reads parquet. A directory archive is read where it lies and
refuses an `into=`.

## Read one too big to hold

**`scan_archive` reads nothing until asked.** The sources come back as paths,
and each frame is read off disk at the call that asks for it:

```python
sweep = sps.scan_archive('sweep.zip', 'sweep/')
sweep.answer.scan('p')  # read at the collect, one name at a time
```

Scan the archive that does not fit in memory, and the one you will read
little of: a load reads every name, a scan only the ones you ask for. What is
scanned has to outlive what it reads off, so a zip needs an `into=` you will
keep.

| | `load_archive` | `scan_archive` |
|---|---|---|
| a source | the table the member holds | the path to it |
| the answer | frames in memory | read at the call that asks |
| a sweep's answer | held: `runs.primal('p')` | spilled: `runs.scan('p')` |
| a zip's `into=` | optional, and scratch without one | required, and kept |

## Read what a solve cost

`metrics` is a `Metrics`: how big the model was, how many solves the clocks
cover, and wall-clock seconds in each phase, as one value
([the attributes](../reference/api.md#diagnostics)).

```python
case = sps.load_archive('case/')

case.metrics.rows  # how big the model was
case.metrics.solves  # how many solves the clocks cover
case.metrics.build_seconds  # turning declarations into frames
```

**The row covers the model's whole life, and `solves` says how long that is.**
`sps.solve` builds the model it solves, so its archive reads `solves` of 1. A
model solved more than once before it was archived carries the sum:

```python
with sps.build('dispatch.yaml', sources) as model:
    model.solve()
    model.solve(archive='second/')  # solves: 2, and the clocks cover both
```

A sweep records each slice's own metrics as `runs.metrics` instead
([sweeps](../reference/sweeps.md)).

## Keep the answer an update produced

An updated model answers the merged data, so archive it where it is
answered:

```python
with sps.build('dispatch.yaml', sources) as model:
    model.update({'p_max': doubled}).solve(archive='case/')
```

## Archive a sweep too large to hold

`spill_to=` writes each slice's frames as the fold goes, so the sweep holds
one slice at a time. `archive=` packs the whole sweep. Pass both and the spill
is what the archive packs, so the sweep is archived without ever being held:

```python
axis = sps.EachCoordinate('scenario')
sps.solve_over('dispatch.yaml', sources, axis, spill_to='work/', archive='sweep/')
```

The archive carries the axis, so the sweep runs again from the file alone:

```python
sweep = sps.scan_archive('sweep/')

sweep.answer.scan('p')  # keyed by scenario, read at the collect
sps.solve_over(sweep.spec, sweep.sources, sweep.axis)
```

`scan_archive` reads a sweep back spilled, as `spill_to=` left it.
`load_archive` reads it back held, where it fits, and `runs.primal('p')`
answers on that one.

## Read a directory of them

A directory of archives is a table per glob, and every row carries `run`, the
archive's own name:

```python
import polars as pl

pl.read_parquet('runs/*/answer/objective.parquet').sort('solved_at')
```

The recipes are [reading a directory of runs](warehouse.md).

## What an archive will not take

**A sweep cut by a hand-built axis.** A list of `(key, sources)` is a set of
sources per slice, and the call is refused before the first slice is solved:

```text
archive= takes a sweep cut by EachCoordinate or EachWindow, which say how one
set of sources was cut and so how the archive can be re-run. A hand-built list
is a set of sources per slice, which are unrelated questions — archive one
solve each.
```

**A directory that already holds something.** A directory archive is written
whole, never merged into what is there. A `.zip` target is replaced.
