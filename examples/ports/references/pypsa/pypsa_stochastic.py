"""Reference for ``pypsa_stochastic``: PyPSA's own two-stage stochastic network. See docs/examples/index.md.

    pixi exec -s uv uv run --script examples/ports/references/pypsa/pypsa_stochastic.py

Pinned above to the versions that produced the number in ``references.json``,
and run out of band — PyPSA is not a dependency of this project. linopy is
pinned because PyPSA builds its model *through* it, so the formulation, and so
the number, is theirs jointly; xarray because it is linopy's data model, where
alignment and broadcasting decide which coefficient lands in which row. pandas
is only a floor: it holds the instance's tables and reshapes the recorded duals.

It reads the same instance the port binds and builds the network with PyPSA's
own objects. Nothing here imports lpspec.

**One dimension separates the two stages.** ``n.set_scenarios`` turns every
operational variable into a scenario-indexed one and leaves the nominal
variables alone: ``Generator-p`` comes out with dims ``(scenario, name,
snapshot)`` and ``Generator-p_nom`` with dims ``(name,)``. Capacity is chosen
once and lives through all three futures; dispatch is chosen after the load is
known. That is the whole content of the port, and it states it by giving
``p`` a ``scenario`` in its ``dims`` and ``p_nom`` none.

**Every objective term is weighted, capital cost included.** ``define_objective``
splits into ``capex_terms`` and ``opex_terms`` and runs both through
``_expected``, which selects each scenario and multiplies by its weight
(``optimize.py:361``). The weights sum to one, so the capital term is unchanged
by the round trip — the port writes it once rather than three times weighted,
which is the same number and the shorter sentence.

**What the expectation is worth** is printed by :func:`what_the_mean_would_build`:
the same network with every scenario replaced by the probability-weighted mean
load builds 141 MW and no peaking plant at all, and that fleet cannot serve the
severe future's 210 MW in any dispatch. The stochastic answer is not the answer
to the averaged question.
