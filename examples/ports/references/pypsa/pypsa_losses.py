"""Reference for ``pypsa_losses``: PyPSA's own tangent transmission losses. See docs/examples/index.md.

    pixi exec -s uv uv run --script examples/ports/references/pypsa/pypsa_losses.py

Pinned above to the versions that produced the number in ``references.json``,
and run out of band — PyPSA is not a dependency of this project. linopy is
pinned because PyPSA builds its model *through* it, so the formulation, and so
the number, is theirs jointly; xarray because it is linopy's data model, where
alignment and broadcasting decide which coefficient lands in which row. pandas
is only a floor: it holds the instance's tables and reshapes the recorded duals.

It reads the same instance the port binds and builds the network with PyPSA's
own objects. Nothing here imports specsolve.

**A quadratic loss, underestimated by its own tangents.** Loss on a passive
branch is ``r * s**2``. PyPSA approximates it from below with a fan of tangent
lines: for each segment *k* it takes the point ``p_k = k/segments * s_nom`` and
adds the tangent there, once for each sign of the flow. Each is a half-plane on
``(loss, s)`` and needs no auxiliary variable at all, which is why this is a
plain linear model rather than a piecewise one.

The loss is subtracted **half at each end** of the branch, which is PyPSA's
convention for where the energy goes.

Three of the six snapshots are quiet on purpose. A fan of segments is only
witnessed by flows that reach them, and with the busy snapshots alone the model
sits on the top two of five throughout — the other three coefficients could
have been anything.

The network is a **path**, b0—b1—b2—b3, and radial on purpose: with no
independent cycle there is no Kirchhoff voltage law to satisfy, so a mismatch
here implicates the loss approximation rather than the voltage law's
technique. ``x`` is
carried in the instance all the same, because it is what makes these lines
passive branches in the first place.

The last line has **no resistance**, and is the reason the instance has four
buses rather than three: PyPSA gives every passive branch a loss variable and
lets ``r = 0`` pin it to nothing, while the port declares the variable only
where there is a curve to approximate. Same model, and the port's spelling is
the one that says which lines dissipate. Its rating is tight enough to bind,
so a port that lost that row would be cheaper rather than merely different.

``r`` is 0.0003 rather than a textbook per-unit figure: PyPSA's loss term is
``r_pu_eff * s**2`` with ``s`` in MW, so a resistance chosen for a per-unit base
makes the loss exceed the flow and the model infeasible. At this value the
losses run about 3% of throughput, which is what a transmission network looks
like.
