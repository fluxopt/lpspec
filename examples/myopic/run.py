"""A myopic investment pathway on lpspec, one period at a time.

    pixi run python examples/myopic/run.py

**This is evidence, not a feature.** It is the shape capacity-expansion models
are actually run in: a handful of investment periods, each solved on a few
typical days, each inheriting the fleet the last one left.

One file, `pathway.yaml`, written for *a* period. The driver supplies which:

    lps.solve_over(model, sources, lps.EachCoordinate('year'),
                   carry={'existing': 'total'})

The periods run in sorted order, which is the order the carry chains them in.
Nothing is dropped here: `total` is over `(generator)` and so is `existing`, so
the whole fleet vector moves forward. That is the myopic case in one line. The
rolling-horizon case (`examples/rolling/`) is the same keyword where a dimension
*is* dropped, and there the row handed on is the last one each window owns.

**The accumulation is in the YAML, not here.** `carry` copies; it never adds.
`total == existing + build` is a constraint in `pathway.yaml`, where it is
reviewable and the linopy oracle can check it — which is the whole reason the
driver has no `combine: add`.

What the run asserts rather than prints:

- period *i+1* starts from exactly the fleet period *i* ended with, which is
  the promise `carry` makes
- capacity never falls, since nothing here retires
