"""The whole architecture, one model, one stage at a time — run it and read.

docs/about/architecture.md describes the pipeline; this script *executes* it one stage at
a time and prints the artifact each stage produces. Nothing here is a
reimplementation: every call is the same public entry point ``lps.solve`` takes
internally, so what you see is what actually runs.

    pixi run python examples/walkthrough.py

Its output is committed as ``examples/walkthrough.out`` and asserted line for
line by ``tests/test_walkthrough.py``, so the narration cannot go stale
unnoticed: a stage that starts saying something else fails CI, and the diff of
the regenerated file is the record of what changed. Everything printed is
therefore deterministic.

The point it is trying to make is the thesis in docs/about/architecture.md: a YAML math
spec is a closed AST known before any data is touched. Stages 1-3 happen with
no data bound at all; only stage 4 sees a number.
